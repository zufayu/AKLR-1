# Memory-bound: limited by global memory traffic

## Symptom

- Bytes moved / wall time is near the stream bandwidth measured on the same box (S1); a rate above it means caches
  serve part of the traffic and the kernel is not at the HBM limit (S2).
- MFMA work added with no extra traffic leaves wall time unchanged: compute is hidden (S3).
- The trace shows `s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)` in front of the MFMAs (S4), or `VMEM-load` stalls dominating at a high
  per-load rate (S5). Historical wrong-output probes deleted `ds_read`s/MFMAs on an M=8 o_proj/K=16384
  build, or compute on short-K builds at m 64–128. Their recorded timing changes are diagnostics only:
  load liveness and scheduling were not isolated, so they establish neither statistical equivalence,
  a sole memory bottleneck nor an upper bound on compute's share (S6).
- How near is near: on fp8 × MXFP4 fused-MoE decode, kernels reading the weights of the experts their routes
  touch at 6.0–6.45 TB/s, against a 6.5 TB/s read roof measured on MI355X, measured 1.04–1.28× over aiter, and
  6.5 TB/s caps what is left at 5–8% *(field, E1)*.

## Likely causes

1. **Few MACs per operand byte.** Per K element a workgroup moves `tile_m · A_row_bytes + tile_n · B_col_bytes` for
   `tile_m · tile_n` MACs (S7); when the last dispatch round is full, intensity is the limit (S8).
2. **Many unique lines.** The cost unit is unique 128-byte lines touched per instruction, not bytes (S9); operand
   rows off a 128 B line add lines (S10).
3. **Refetch across XCDs.** L2 is per XCD and workgroup ids go round-robin over the 8 XCDs, so a linear tile order
   spreads tiles that share a panel over all 8 L2s (S11).
4. **Latency or a compiler drain, not bandwidth.** `vmcnt(0)` in front of the MFMAs means either exposed global
   latency or a conservative drain the compiler inserted (S4).
5. **The C store,** when deleting the whole store is the only epilogue ablation that moves the time (S12).

## Rule out first

- **A warm ruler.** A replayed weight stays in the MALL/L2 while decode reads it cold (S13): rotate an explicit
  number of B copies past the MALL (S14). Price headroom against a ceiling measured at the kernel's own byte count,
  not the datasheet (S15).
- **Bytes from a guess.** For a MoE, count the experts the timed inputs' routes touch, not the uniform estimate
  `E_local · (1 − (1 − k/E)^tokens)`: under expert parallelism the two differ (88 against 97 local experts at 112 tokens),
  and so does the floor *(field, E1)*.
- **A fixed per-tile cost:** TF/s rising with K is the same curve (S16); fit it (`gemm/grid_pricing.md` §6).
- **An idle grid:** with fewer tiles than CUs, each workgroup walks all of K (S17); see `low_cu_utilization.md`.
- **ATT charging:** an MFMA waiting for its operand is charged to the MFMA, not to an `s_waitcnt` (S18).

## Candidate techniques

- Widen the tile, with `tile_m : tile_n` set by the operand widths — `gemm/grid_pricing.md` §1, §3 — on
  full rounds of a compute- or feed-bound tile at large M, to a tile that still fills whole rounds (S8, S19). A
  narrower tile where the last round is partial (S20) paid on the backward shapes of an MXFP4 training GEMM and lost
  in every case tried on two bf16 GEMMs at M 256–4096 (`gemm/grid_pricing.md` §1): race it. On a small-M row that
  streams B from HBM, the listed grid-enlargement attempts did not pay; idle CUs alone do not establish
  recoverable bandwidth. Other tile/grid configurations still need measurement (`gemm/grid_pricing.md` §1,
  `gemm/small_m.md` §2–3).
- Operand rows on whole 128 B lines — `gemm/datapath.md` §6, §10 — for cause 2 (S10); merging requests
  pays only when it also cuts unique lines (S21).
- XCD / L2 tile order — `gemm/schedule_and_locality.md` §2 — when co-resident workgroups reuse a slab;
  not once one band's operand slice outgrows an XCD's L2 (S22); judge by wall time and stall counters such as
  `MemUnitStalled`, not L2 hit rate (S23).
- Prefetch, deeper stages — `gemm/datapath.md` §7, `../flydsl/guides.md` § prefetch-data-load — when independent
  work can fill the latency (S24); not when the working set thrashes L2 (S25), nor across a register tier (S26).
- Cache policy on B and on C — `gemm/small_m.md` §6, `gemm/epilogue.md` §5 — a raced
  per-configuration axis whose sign depends on the shape (S27, S28).
- Dense decode streaming rows (measured on one o_proj) — `gemm/small_m.md` §2–3 — there split-K and more blocks
  lose (S29).
- The C store — `gemm/epilogue.md` §2 — run its three ablations before changing it (S12).
- Other kernel families: attention gathers, unique lines and the index distribution —
  `attention/decode_split_kv.md` §7; bytes per score and GQA sharer merging —
  `attention/grid_dispatch.md` §9; cache policy on MoE weights at decode sizes —
  `moe/grouped_moe_inference.md` §4.
