# Wait-free split-K fold

## What it does

A one-launch split-K GEMM has to add the splits' partial tiles. A fold in which an owner split polls flags, or
launch-tagged data, until its partners have published is right only while every workgroup of the launch is
resident at once: when fewer CUs are free (a stream limited to part of the GPU, another kernel holding CUs), the
waiting workgroups hold the slots their partners need, and the fold gives up or hangs. Here no workgroup ever waits.
Each split publishes its partial, counts itself in on an atomic counter for its tile, and the split that finds all
the others already counted does the whole fold; the others exit. A second form has no counter: each split tags what
it publishes with the launch and reads its partners' tags back, and whichever split finds them all folds
(§ Folding without a counter: launch-tagged slots).

## How to write it

In the kernel above (line numbers of `kernel.py`):

1. Each split stores its packed partial into its own plane with `sc0 sc1` (`_SC01 = 17`, line 49), which bypasses
   the non-coherent caches so the data meets across XCDs (S1).
2. `s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)` and a barrier: the stores are acknowledged before the split counts in (line 426, S2).
3. Thread 0 adds 1 to the tile's counter with an agent-scope atomic add that returns the old count, and passes the
   old count to its workgroup through LDS (line 430, S3).
4. The split that read `SPLIT - 1` folds: it loads every plane, its own included, with `sc0 sc1` and adds them in
   split order (line 440, S4). Its own partial goes through the same packing as the published ones, so the sum is
   bitwise the same whichever split folds.
5. Make the counters valid for this call, in one of four ways (the last three tag the counter word with the launch):
   - Zero them in the call with `torch.zeros` before launching the GEMM. The split that folds also resets its tile's
     counter with an `xchg` (S5), but no later call relies on that reset. This costs a launch per call (Cost and risk).
   - Or tag the counter word with the launch, and allocate it with `torch.empty` beside the partials (S8). On a bf16
     GEMM with N = K = 6144, thread 0 of each split runs a compare-and-swap loop on a 64-bit word holding
     `tag << 2 | count`: a word with another tag counts as 0, and the split whose swap saw count `SPLIT - 1` under
     its own tag folds (S6, S7). The tag is a 62-bit hash of the dispatch id and the queue address; it must not
     repeat within a queue the way a 32-bit tag does (Cost and risk). Use monotonic ordering on the swap, since
     step 2 already acknowledged the data: *(field, E11)* with acq_rel the compiler put `buffer_wbl2 sc1` and
     `buffer_inv sc1` around every swap, and m=64 took 23.30 µs against 12.87 on another bf16 GEMM (N=2048,
     K=7168). *(field, E16)* Agent-scope fences around the arrival in place of the scoped stores and loads cost
     about as much at m 1024–4096: at N=256, K=6144, m=1024 24.7 against 14.0 µs (same build otherwise); at N=64,
     K=4096, m=4096 26.18 µs (KW 4, 2 stages) against 11.92 with `sc0 sc1` (KW 2, 3 stages; partials alone read
     11.35 and 9.74 in those two configurations).
   - Or reset a stale word, then add (bf16 GEMM N=64, K=4096, m=4096, split 4). Thread 0 reads its tile's 64-bit
     word before the first DMA. After the main loop, if the word's high 56 bits are not this launch's tag (the
     dispatch id plus the queue pointer times an odd constant), it compare-and-swaps the value it read to
     `tag << 8`; a split that already counted in has changed the word, so that swap fails. Once its partial stores
     are acknowledged it adds 1, and the split that gets back `tag << 8 | S − 1` folds (S14). *(field, E12)* With
     the reset disabled the output held 262,144 NaN within 40 calls; with the scratch prefilled with random words
     before each of 40 calls alternating two inputs, every output was bitwise equal to the clean one.
   - Or, with two splits, exchange instead of count (bf16 GEMM N=256, K=6144, m=512). Once a wave's partial stores
     are acknowledged, its lane 0 swaps the launch tag into that wave's 8-byte word of the tile's 128 B slot; the
     wave that gets this launch's tag back arrives second, swaps a sentinel back for the next launch, and adds its
     partner's partial to its own, kept in registers (S15, S16). *(field, E13)* Its first version, one word per tile
     swapped by the workgroup and no sentinel, read 7.95–7.97 µs against 8.36–8.39 for the compare-and-swap chain it
     replaced at m=512; the sentinel (with the partner loads issued first) and the per-wave words, added in the next
     round, read 7.963 → 7.986 and 7.970 → 7.925 µs at m=512 (7.957 in the final bench). The delivered kernel's tag
     is the dispatch id alone and passed `driver.py --stress`; give it the queue bits of Cost and risk all the same.

   The planes sit in the call's own `torch.empty` workspace, written before they are read. AKLR no longer provides
   kernel state.

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § wait_free_fold How to write it.

## Folding without a counter: launch-tagged slots

Each split publishes its partial together with a tag of this launch, waits until its own stores are acknowledged,
then reads every split's tag. A split that finds all of them adds the partials in split order and writes the output.
The historical implementations use no counter, atomic or zeroing launch. Their stress and repeat records
reported no wrong output, but do not prove that the last acknowledged publisher must observe every tag.
Matching tags must also identify this call's fully published partials; old matching tags remain a separate risk.
The per-element layout assumes a 16 B store is not observed half written (new tag, old partial), which was
not checked. The per-wave layout publishes its tag after its planes are acknowledged, avoiding that particular
combined-store assumption, not proving the entire protocol. Two historical layouts allocate scratch with
`torch.empty` in the call (S11, S13); their final delivery identities were not established:

- **The tag beside every element** (bf16 GEMM N=128, K=6144, m=64 and 128, split 4). Each thread stores one 16 B
  slot per element, the fp32 partial and a 96-bit tag (the dispatch id's two words and the queue pointer's low word),
  with `sc0 sc1`; waits `vmcnt(0)`; loads that element's slot from every split; and writes C if all the tags match
  (S9, S10). One store and one load round per element, with no LDS or barrier in the decision.
- **One tag per (tile, wave) slot** (bf16 GEMM N=2048, K=7168, m 16–128, split 4). Each wave stores its planes with
  `sc0 sc1`, waits `vmcnt(0)`, stores the 64-bit tag `dispatch.id ^ rotl(queue.ptr, 32)` into its own slot, waits
  again, loads the slots of its wave index in every split, makes the result uniform with `readfirstlane`, and folds
  if all match (S12). A wave reads its partners' planes only when it folds.

What it costs:

- **Keep the `vmcnt(0)` between the publication and the reads:** without it no split is guaranteed to see every
  tag. *(field, E9)* On the per-element form no arm timed its removal alone: one that dropped it and also wrote C
  from every split read 6.044 µs against 4.740 at m=64, and reading first, then again behind the wait on a miss, was
  37–41% slower than the historical same-run canonical build at m=64 and m=128.
- **At m 64–128, most of what the fold costs is the peer reads.** *(field, E9)* On the per-element form at
  m=64 (8×16 tiles), the full fold read 4.740 µs against 4.397 with the store and its wait but no peer reads, and
  4.419 without the scratch store; at m=128 (16×16 tiles, split-major placement), 5.708 against 4.708 and 4.487. In
  the delivered kernel (compact tile block per XCD, 384 threads) the store, wait and peer reads together cost about
  0.04 µs at m=64 and 0.62 µs at m=128.
- *(field, E10)* The per-wave slots beat the same kernel's launch-tagged counter (compare-and-swap) by 1.3–9.5% at
  m=32, 64 and 128 (N=2048, K=7168).
- **At m 1024–4096 the arrival costs as much as the reads** (counter forms, timing-only arms). *(field, E14)* At
  N=64, K=4096, m=4096 (split 4): partials alone 8.05 µs, with `sc0 sc1` stores, `vmcnt(0)` and barrier 8.18, with
  the counter round trip 9.38, with the fold 10.29. At N=128, K=6144, m=2048 (split 4, compare-and-swap arrival):
  10.58 → 12.76 with the arrival → 15.44 with the fold, against 13.06–13.08 unsplit. At N=256, K=6144, m=1024 a
  fixed folder with no arrival read 11.27 against 12.55–12.92 for the full fold.
- **Spread tiles' counters apart; one tile's per-wave words may share a line.** *(field, E13)* At N=64, m=4096,
  tiles' counters 8 B apart read 10.42 µs, and 64, 128 and 256 B apart 10.08, 10.10 and 10.05 (single runs; +4.3% at
  that m in the ablation of the 256 B round), so two counters in one 128 B line did as well as a line each; at N=256
  per-wave words 8 B apart in one 128 B slot per tile read 7.94 / 10.89 µs (m=512 / 1024) against 8.00 / 10.93 with
  a line per wave.

Where one launch with this fold paid, against the same kernel file's path without a split:

- *(field, E8)* N=128, K=6144: m=64 4.732 µs against 4.940; m=128 5.299–5.314 against 5.556–5.585, but only with
  a compact block of tiles and all their splits on each XCD: split-major and
  one-run-per-XCD placements read 5.776 and 5.923 there.
- *(field, E10)* N=2048, K=7168: m=16 7.80 µs against 8.49–8.64 (driver 8.63 → 7.91); it lost at m=8 (7.71 against
  7.00); at m=1 it read 7.65 against the whole-K kernel's 6.65, but the latter was a driver reading, not the same
  timer.
- *(field, E15)* At M 512–4096 on narrow N, at a full round of 256 workgroups, where the split bought a wider tile
  (`grid_pricing.md` §2): N=256, K=6144, m=512 (split 2: +4.8% at that m with a compare-and-swap arrival, and
  +5.6% more in the next combination round) and m=1024 (split 2, then 4: +2.8% and +2.2% at that m).
  These N256 rounds also changed rotation/PRO and exchange with own-partial retention; the numbers are
  not isolated exchange or split effects. At N=64,
  K=4096, m=4096 (reset counter, split 4: the round reported +1.9% at that Point but +0.22% [−0.77, +1.21]
  over five Points, with the interval crossing zero and fold marked not_separable; the untouched m=256
  also moved by up to 2.7%). Counter spacing's +4.3% came in a subsequent round against a different parent,
  not the same isolated fold comparison. It lost at N=128, K=6144, m=2048, N=64 at m=1024 and N=256 at m=256;
  N=64/m=2048 did not pass the keep gate, rather than establishing a definite loss (`grid_pricing.md` §2). A
  separate reduce launch lost at N=64, m=2048: GEMM 7.64 µs, reduce kernel 4.32 and a memset 4.04 (11.42 in the
  driver, against 8.69 for the unsplit kernel).

What was checked, and what was not, is under Cost and risk.

## When it applies

- Any kernel whose workgroups combine results through global memory: split-K GEMM folds, split-KV attention
  merges, cross-workgroup reductions. This is what correctness requires there; whether a one-launch split pays is a
  separate question, measured on bf16 GEMMs only: on `gemm_n6144_k16384` (30–95 µs kernels) with zeroed counters,
  which cost a per-call zero kernel *(field, E4)* and a one-workgroup fold *(field, E1)*; on N = K = 6144 with a
  launch-tagged counter, where it beat a separate fold launch at m=64 and lost at m=128 *(field, E7)*; and on
  4–14 µs kernels with launch-tagged slots, where it paid at some M and lost at others (§ Folding without a counter:
  launch-tagged slots). Time it against split-K 1 and against a separate fixed-order reduce at each M you are
  scored on.
- The result stays bitwise reproducible if the fold adds in a fixed order (split index), never in arrival order.

## Counter-signals

- A fold that waits is faster where its work spreads over all splits: the owner-per-slice spin fold beat this one
  by 15.6% at m=128 (8 splits, one workgroup now reads 7 planes) and by 22% at m=256 on a larger tile
  *(field, E1)*. That speed is not available safely; take it from fewer splits or a cheaper partial format instead.
- A pairwise tree in fixed order does not help: each level waits for its own stores to be acknowledged, and the
  splits of a tile finish close together, so the last split pays every level. It was no faster than the flat
  fold at m=128 and 1.7-2.9% slower at m=32, 64, 256 and 512 *(field, E2)*.
- A separate fold launch can still win: on a bf16 GEMM with N = K = 6144 at m=128 (split 4, 96 columns per
  workgroup), the launch-tagged counter fold read 24.66 µs against 23.87 for the fold launch, and 24.05 against
  23.82 with its loads batched; in the first version, removing the fold's loads brought it to 21.03 µs and removing
  the swap as well to 20.05 *(field, E7)*.

## How to confirm it took effect

- The final ISA has no loop around the flag or plane loads, and no `s_sleep`. A compare-and-swap loop that retries
  only because the value it expected was out of date (a stale word on the first try, or another split's swap in
  between) is not a wait: it never depends on a split that has not run. The per-element tagged slots show
  `buffer_store_dwordx4 sc0 sc1`, then `s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`, then one `buffer_load_dwordx4 sc0 sc1` per split
  (E8).
- On streams limited to 16 and 64 CUs (`hipExtStreamCreateWithCUMask`), and beside a second call of its own on
  another stream, every workload's output is bit for bit its output alone; forge_task's `driver.py --stress` runs
  this. A fold that waits failed it with millions of NaN at m=256 and 512 *(field, E3)*.

## Cost and risk

- The counter fold's whole read goes through one workgroup: the cost grows with the split count (E1).
- Each call owns its counters and partials, so overlapping calls do not share synchronization memory.
- Zeroing per-call counters adds one kernel to every split-K call: *(field, E5)* one `torch.zeros(64, int32)`
  before a bf16 GEMM (N=4096, K=2048, m=128) took the call from 8.013 to 11.909 µs. Historical comparison against
  the removed kernel-state interface: *(field, E4)* 4.2 µs at m=32, 4.2 at m=64, 4.7 at m=128, 3.1 at m=256 and
  4.1 at m=512 against the counters in state.
- **A launch tag can replace the zeroing; a 32-bit tag is known to be unsafe, and a wider one is only as safe as no
  leftover word equalling this launch's tag** (next bullets). `dispatch.id` XOR `queue.ptr` is 32 bits and repeats
  (dispatch ids 1 and 2^32 + 1 on one queue), and a stale word that reads as this launch's, already complete, means no
  split sees `SPLIT - 1` and the tile is never written.
- A dispatch-derived tag (the id itself or an odd-multiplier hash), one to one only in its stated 62–64-bit
  domain on a fixed queue, was combined with queue-pointer bits and used instead of zeroing.
  Truncating queue bits or XOR does not guarantee cross-queue uniqueness. These tags appeared in three historical bf16 implementations whose
  records reported passing `driver.py --stress`; final delivery identity and protocol safety are not established: the launch-tagged counter (N = K = 6144, m=64; +0.66% [+0.52, +0.80] over a separate fold
  launch, m=64 +5.9% *(field, E6)*) and both slot layouts above *(field, E8, E10)*. The queue bits matter: a second
  stream's dispatch ids started again at 0 *(field, E7)*. Also checked: the dispatch id was the
  same in every workgroup of a launch and different in each launch, eager and in graph replays; a 200-round NaN and
  determinism check, and up to 1,500 calls per case with NaN-prefilled outputs, some on a second stream, plus 200
  replays of a 20-call graph, gave no wrong output *(field, E8, E10)*. At M 2048–4096 two other tagged builds gave
  none either: the 56-bit reset-then-add kernel, with scratch prefilled with random words before each of 40 calls
  alternating two inputs (E12), and an undelivered N=128 compare-and-swap build at m=2048, with garbage or reused
  scratch and with inputs changed between graph replays (E14). No record checked dispatch-id wraparound or a stale
  or garbage word equal to this launch's tag; on the per-wave form, a workspace prefilled with 0xFF and a reused
  workspace with alternating inputs were not run either (E10).
- Where the tags may live: `aklr/ops/README.md` (lines 180–181) lets scratch be allocated in the call
  (`torch.empty`, …) or once per shape in a compile function, and asks "rewritten whole by every call before it is
  read" of the latter; it does not say whether in-call scratch may be read before this call writes it, and line 214
  asks that what `run` does depend only on this call. A tag read before this call writes it can only live in scratch
  allocated in the call, and its correctness rests on no leftover word equalling this launch's tag. `../SKILL.md`
  § Stop says to zero workspaces in each call before any read, which a tag does not do.
