## Route here when
- You are choosing or writing the K loop of a GEMM: wave count, LDS buffering, where the waits go,
  and whether the loop should be one inline-asm region.
- An inline-asm MFMA or loop compiles and runs but produces wrong numbers on some shapes.
- You are deciding between AGPR and VGPR accumulators, or between MFMA atoms.

Grid, tile and split-K pricing are in `grid_pricing.md`. Wait counts, priority and tile order
are in `schedule_and_locality.md`. LDS layout, global→LDS DMA and M0 are in
`datapath.md`. The C store is in `epilogue.md`.

## The baseline: FlyDSL's 2-stage ping-pong (`preshuffle_gemm`)

FlyDSL's guide walks through this design in detail (`../flydsl/guides.md` § gemm-optimization); the essentials:
- **Four waves split `tile_n`; B never touches LDS.** B is preshuffled on the host into the MFMA register
  layout and loaded straight to VGPRs (guide §4.2, §12). LDS holds only A, in two buffers (guide §2).
- **Each loop iteration covers two K tiles, one per buffer.** For each: load the next A tile into the idle
  buffer and the next B tile into registers, run the MFMAs on the current buffer, then `s_waitcnt` + barrier
  (guide §2.3, §4.4).
- **Scheduling-group hints spread the loads over the MFMAs**, one group per instruction class (VMEM reads, LDS
  reads, LDS writes, MFMAs), with counts that come from this tile (guide §5; `schedule_and_locality.md` §3).
- **Async copy (gfx950).** Moving A global→LDS by DMA frees A's staging VGPRs (guide §11).
  *(field, E1)* Staging A or B through VGPRs + `ds_write` instead of DMA lost 10–15% on a bf16 8-wave loop at M=16384 (timing-only builds; their output was not checked).
- Budget it with the guide's formulas: MFMAs per tile (§1.5), LDS per stage (§2.4), VGPRs (§10).

The 8-wave and 4-wave designs below put both operands through LDS and use larger tiles.

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § mainloop The baseline: FlyDSL's 2-stage ping-pong (`preshuffle_gemm`).

## 1. Two large-tile loop designs — race them, do not pick by rule

| | 8-wave software pipeline | 4-wave whole-loop |
|---|---|---|
| Threads / wave grid | 512, waves 2×4 (`wave_m = wid//4`, `wave_n = wid%4`) | 256, waves 2×2 |
| Occupancy | 2 waves per SIMD | 1 wave per SIMD (the whole 512-register file is one wave's) |
| K loop | compiler-scheduled, fully unrolled (`K_ITERS-2` iterations) | one inline-asm region with a hardware loop |
| LDS | 8 buffers: A/B × cur/next × two halves | operand pools of mixed depth (A 2-deep, B 3-deep) |
| Where it wins | short K, where the epilogue is a large share of the time and the second wave per SIMD overlaps it | long K, where the steady state amortizes an epilogue that nothing overlaps |
| Turbo source | FP8 `_compile_dense_nt` (:85) | FP8 `_dense_nt_wave4_asm` (:2187), `_dense_tn_wave4_asm` (:1401); FP4 `MfmaScaleFp4` |

A 4-wave design can also keep a compiled K loop: the same 2×2 wave split (a 128×128 block per wave, quadrants
c00/c01/c10/c11) with an 8-buffer, depth-2 LDS ping-pong, and one inline-asm block per MFMA to keep the
accumulator in AGPRs. Turbo's 4-wave design runs all of K as one asm region (§3). The LDS argument below holds
for every 2×2 split.

**Why the 4-wave tile wins on long K.** A 2×2-wave split of a 256×256 tile gives each wave a 128×128
block. That is 64 MACs per operand element per K step, against 42.7 for the 8-wave's 128×64 wave blocks,
so the 4-wave tile issues 1.5× fewer LDS reads per MAC. *(field, E2, E3)* On an MXFP4 GEMM at M=N=8192 (Turbo's
4-wave whole loop against its 8-wave intrinsic build), the 8-wave/4-wave LDS instruction ratio was 1.49× at K=28672. The 4-wave lead grew with K, from 6.4% at K=8192 to 10.5% at K=28672.
Turbo's own comment gives the mechanism on a power-capped part: "the whole-loop moves a third less LDS
traffic per MFMA, which buys clock" (FP8:3200). Sharing an operand between two such wave groups does not buy that
back: *(field, E25)* on a fused-MoE fp8 × MXFP4 stage 1, two 4-wave 64×256 groups sharing B through LDS (8 waves,
128 VGPRs, 44 spilled) issued 1.5–1.6× the LDS instructions of one 4-wave group at 234 VGPRs, with the same MFMA busy
cycles, and ran 14–18% slower; with two waves per group (256 VGPRs, no spill), still 2–5% slower.

**Why it loses on short K.** At one wave per SIMD nothing overlaps the epilogue. Turbo therefore only
offers the whole loop when `ceil(K/128) >= 16` (`_NT4_MIN_K_ITERS`, FP8:3203). Above that it compiles
both designs and races them on the first call for each shape (`_autotune_nt_dispatch`, FP8:3210; see
`autotune.md`). Do the same in your own kernel: the crossover depends on the shape and on the
epilogue, so no fixed rule works.

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § mainloop §1.

## 2. The 8-wave pipeline (FP8 `_compile_dense_nt`)

- **LDS.** Eight LDS buffers: A/B × cur/next × two halves (FP8:134-142).
  A 256×256×128 fp8 tile uses 128 KiB.
- **Quadrants.** Each wave owns four accumulator quadrants, c00/c01/c10/c11. One iteration interleaves
  four S2R fragment loads, the next tiles' G2S fills and four MFMA clusters (FP8:264-310):
  ```
  b0 = S2R(b_cur0); a0 = S2R(a_cur0); G2S(a_next1, k+1); s_barrier
  s_setprio(1); c00 = mfma(a0, b0); s_setprio(0); s_barrier
  b1 = S2R(b_cur1); G2S(b_cur0, k+2); s_barrier
  ... c01, c10 ...
  G2S(b_cur1, k+2); wait_barrier(2*nA + nB)          # s_waitcnt vmcnt(n); s_barrier
  s_setprio(1); c11 = mfma(a1, b1); s_setprio(0); s_barrier
  s_waitcnt vmcnt(3)                                   # end-of-iteration drain
  swap cur/next names in Python
  ```
- **Every barrier is load-bearing.** The kernel docstring says "each guards a compiler-reorder race".
  *(field, E4)* On Turbo's MXFP4 4-wave whole loop, every attempt to drop a barrier produced an operand race; the cross-wave cause is a missing
  LDS rendezvous, not out-of-order `vmcnt`.
- **The end-of-iteration drain is a correctness knob, not a tuning knob.** `nt_vmcnt=3` is documented
  at FP8:92: N=3 gave bitwise-repeatable output at ≤1.1% cost, N≥4 raced, N<3 was slower *(field, E5)*.
  - If you build this pipeline, sweep the drain with a bitwise repetition gate (`correctness.md` §3),
    never with SNR alone.
- **`s_setprio(1)` … `s_setprio(0)` around each MFMA cluster.** At two waves per SIMD this lets the wave
  that reached its MFMAs keep the matrix pipe. Always drop priority afterwards. The whole-loop kernels at
  one wave per SIMD use none.
  - *(field, E6, E7, E8, E9)* Added alone to three other loops at two waves per SIMD it did not pay:
    ~4% slower on an 8-wave DMA loop without per-cluster barriers, neutral to ~4% slower on compiler- or
    hint-scheduled 2-stage loops with one barrier per K step. Race it; do not port it.
  - *(field, E32)* Nor remove it unraced: on an 8-wave bf16 pipe at two waves per SIMD (N=7168, K=512), dropping the
    per-cluster `s_setprio` it came with cost 2.9% at m=2048 and 2.0% at m=4096; at m=1024 it read 0.6% faster in
    one race and 10.56–10.71 against 10.59–10.76 µs in a 4-process confirmation. Priority added to four other bf16
    kernels at m 256–4096 read 0.2–4% slower or within noise.
- **If a third full stage overflows LDS, give one operand a third stage.** *(field, E10)* ~11% on a bf16
  192×256×64 tile at M=9397, against a ~13% ceiling with the loop-top wait removed; deepening A or B gained the same.
  *(field, E11)* On 224–352-row bf16 tiles of another kernel either operand's third stage was neutral to 4% slower: race it.
  *(field, E33)* At K=512 (8 K-blocks per tile) on bf16 GEMMs: at N=28672 one-round launches read faster with three
  stages for both operands and C staged in a B stage the last K-block freed (m=256, 11.17 → 10.88 µs in-process) and
  with A 2 / B 3 (m=512, driver 18.60 → 17.91–17.97; in-process 15.46 against 15.49), but a separate in-process run
  read both slower (12.09 against 11.79, 16.99 against 16.92); the round, with computed load waits, was recorded at
  +19.2% and +9.0% at those m. At N=7168, m=2048 the 2026-11 FlyDSL 0.3.2 record read 1.2–1.8% faster for
  the A 2 / B 3 + A-before-B loads + vmcnt(4) + out-of-K B-load zeroing + C-in-A-stage-0 bundle, not B depth alone.
  *(field, E36)* Recompiling the original canonical and iter-006 sources/configurations reduced latency by 0.970%
  (CI −1.015% to −0.925%) at that M; the third B stage's separate contribution was not isolated.
  *(field, E33)* The historical A-3 arm at m=1024 read slower; its discarded source is still missing, so its direction
  was not independently retested. This is an evidence gap, not a prohibition on A 3 or a claim that the original arm was infeasible.
  At N=3584, m=4096 A 3 / B 2 paid 2.5%, and A 5 / B 4 at m=256 failed the 16-CU stress check, cause not found.
  Do not halve the K tile to make room for more stages (`datapath.md`).
- **Edge cases the prologue must cover.** The prologue primes k=0 and k=1. When `K_ITERS == 2` the main
  loop is skipped, so the prologue's own wait must drain what the epilogue reads (FP8:257-262).
- **Code size grows with K** because the loop is fully unrolled. That is acceptable for an 8-wave tile
  at moderate K. It is one reason the whole loop exists.

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § mainloop §2.

## 3. The 4-wave whole loop: one inline-asm region for all of K

The K loop is one inline-asm region. The loop label and back edge are part of the asm string
(`s_add_u32 cnt; s_cmp_lt_u32; s_cbranch_scc1 1b`, FP8:2355-2359).

What this buys:
- No compiler-generated code between iterations, so the compiler cannot insert a conservative `vmcnt(0)` or
  move instructions across the phases. Every wait is the one you wrote.
- Code size does not grow with K. The trip count can be a compile-time constant or a runtime SGPR.
- A fully unrolled K loop can outgrow the instruction cache: a source comment puts one 4-wave MXFP4 loop at
  "full unroll -> 111KB > 32KB I-cache" (FlyDSL's `kernels/gemm/fp4_gemm_4wave.py:651`).
- *(field, E12)* On Turbo's MXFP4 4-wave dense kernel, the whole-loop rewrite was a key lever.

How Turbo structures it (FP8:1133-1230, 2187-2412):
- **Operand pools.** A macro tile is described as `(side, width, nbuf)` pools. The NT square tile is
  `((A,128,2),(A,128,2),(B,128,3),(B,128,3))` (FP8:2049). The B pools are 3 deep so their loads stay in
  flight across a phase drain. Deep pools are issued last, so their loads are the youngest in flight: a
  partial `vmcnt(N)` drain waits for the shallow pools and leaves the deep pools' loads outstanding
  (assert, FP8:2323).
- **Passes and phases.** One pass is `lcm(nbuf)` phases, here 6 K-blocks, so every pass ends with every
  pool back on buffer 0 and the loop body is identical each pass (`_tn4_phases`, FP8:1187; assert
  FP8:2324).
- **Inside a phase.** MFMAs run in a code-generated order: srcA pool outermost, walking a diagonal
  (`_tn4_mfma_order`, FP8:2165). Each operand fragment is re-read from LDS right after its last
  consuming MFMA. The G2S fills for a later phase are spread evenly over the MFMA slots that have no
  refill (FP8:2306). An `s_nop 0` goes between instruction groups (`_tn4_pad`, FP8:1175): at one wave per
  SIMD, memory issue arriving in bursts back-pressures the matrix pipe.
- **Phase boundary.** `s_waitcnt vmcnt(n_flight) lgkmcnt(drain_lgkm)` then `s_barrier`. `n_flight`
  counts only the fills nothing reads before a later phase. The barrier is required because a wave's
  `ds_read`s consume chunks that every wave's DMA wrote.
- **Peeled first and last phases.** The first pass is peeled so its opening MFMAs take `src2=0` and
  write the accumulators directly. That removes the zero-fill: one VALU per accumulator dword, 256 per
  tile in FP4. The closing phase is handed back as SSA values, so the epilogue can be scheduled between
  its MFMAs (FP8:2366-2368, 2703-2708).
- **Persistent carry.** When a workgroup walks several tiles, the closing phases prefetch the next tile's
  first K-blocks into buffers the next tile does not re-prime (`_nt4_carry_bufs`, FP8:2512).
- **Buffer select is free.** Each pool keeps one set of per-lane addresses. The buffer and tile deltas
  go into the 16-bit `ds_read` offset field (`_Tn4Pool` asserts the sum stays below 65536, FP8:1208).

*(field, E13)* In one 4-wave whole loop built this way, on a grouped fp8 GEMM (its weight-gradient pass), the
emit order was a sharp local optimum. Every perturbation lost:

| Perturbation | Effect on the weight-gradient group's geomean speed ratio against a frozen MXFP8 kernel (0.9696 before) |
|---|---|
| Refill two MFMAs later (to avoid a read-after-write) | −0.9 pp |
| All G2S fills at the head of the phase | −15% (a run of `buffer_load … lds` stalls the MFMA stream) |
| Spread fills by instruction count instead of by MFMA slot | −8% |
| Separate each `m0` write from its `buffer_load` by one slot | −0.7 pp |

*(field, E14)* At two waves per SIMD (an 8-wave bf16 loop) the head burst was fine: spreading the fills over the MFMAs lost 0–4%.
*(field, E24)* Also at two waves per SIMD, on a fused-MoE stage 1, moving the last 4 of a step's 12 VMEM loads behind
the first MFMA group gained 1.1%, while spreading all 12 over five groups lost 0.6% at one of two sizes: race head splits too.

After the order is right, the next gain comes from changing the work (tile shape, quadrants, boundary
bodies), not from re-ordering.

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § mainloop §3.

## 4. Register plan and inline-asm constraints

**The plan.** Accumulators are `"=a"` outputs in AGPRs, up to 64 `vector<4xf32>` (256 AGPRs, FP8:1123).
Any beyond that go to a pinned arch-VGPR window. Operand fragments sit in a pinned VGPR window starting
at `v8` (FP8:1122). The loop counter and the per-pool soffsets are early-clobber SGPR outputs.

**Constraint rules.** Each of these has produced silently wrong output:
1. **A zero accumulator is a literal `src2=0`, never a VALU-zeroed register tied in.** The hazard
   recognizer cannot see an MFMA inside inline asm, so it cannot pad the two wait states a VALU write
   needs before an MFMA reads it. Turbo's `asm_mma_do` checks for a zero-fill vector and emits `0`
   (GH:1597-1635; the comment cites CDNA4 ISA §7.6, Table 38).
2. **An output that lives in arch VGPRs must be early-clobber (`=&v` / `=&{v[a:b]}`).** Without `&` the
   allocator may place an input (a `ds_read` base, a voffset) inside the output range. The asm then
   overwrites it mid-loop. *(field, E15)* Moving accumulators from AGPR to VGPR without `&` passed 3 of 10
   shapes and collapsed the other 7 to 0–2 dB, depending on tile count, not on K. Every ISA check stayed
   green. Adding `&` fixed all of them and changed no ISA byte. `&` and a tied operand (`"0"`) are
   mutually exclusive: a tied output shares its input's register by definition.
3. **An unwritten `=&s` output is a register-allocation hazard** (FP8:1430). Write every declared output.
4. **A loop inside the asm needs `~{scc}` in the clobbers.** Without it LLVM can keep an outer loop's
   exit condition in SCC across the blob. *(field, E16)* The back edge became a bare `s_cbranch_scc1` with no
   `s_cmp`, giving a wrong trip count and a memory fault. Fully unrolled callers looked fine, so the bug
   stayed latent until a loop was rolled.
5. **Waits that order an intrinsic DMA need `~{memory}`**, and asm `ds_read`s must drain their own
   `lgkmcnt` before their consumer (`datapath.md` §4).
6. **An untied "pin" (`"=a,v"`) deletes the operand.** See `correctness.md` §7.

**AGPR or VGPR accumulators.** Judge by the shuttle traffic (`v_accvgpr_read/write/mov` counts in the
hot loop) and by wall time, not by `accum_offset` or register totals.
- A scaled MFMA needs `dst` and `src2` in the same file but takes srcA/srcB from either. FP4 therefore
  swaps register files: the accumulator slices live in arch VGPRs and the A/B fragments in AGPRs, so the
  C store packs straight out of arch VGPRs with no shuttle (`_MXFP4_ARCH_ACC`, FP4:578-582).
- The same trade on the fp8 NT whole loop "measured a wash" (FP8:2045-2047): an MFMA writing an arch
  VGPR that a VALU then reads needs wait states that the single wave per SIMD has nothing to fill.
- *(field, E17)* At unchanged occupancy, freed registers buy nothing on their own. In one attention kernel, releasing 72
  VGPRs and 72 AGPRs cost −2.05%. Name the specific gain the headroom is for before building it.

**Setting `amdgpu-agpr-alloc` and friends.** Without the attribute, an inline-asm AGPR
accumulator gets the default allocation, and the result is wrong. After setting any kernel attribute,
read `.agpr_count`, `.vgpr_count` and the waves-per-eu fields from the ISA (§10).

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § mainloop §4.

## 5. MFMA atom choice

- FlyDSL's guide lists the atom per dtype (`../flydsl/guides.md` § gemm-optimization (FlyDSL's §6.2)).
- fp8 and MX formats on gfx950 use `v_mfma_f32_16x16x128_f8f6f4`, or its scaled form for MX. The
  operand formats come from `cbsz` (A) and `blgp` (B); the operand tuple width must match the format
  (fp4 takes 4 dwords).
- **bf16 MFMA atoms: race 16x16x32 and 32x32x16 on the target kernel and ruler, including at the power cap.**
  In the recorded swap the accumulator count, operand bytes and `ds_read` count stayed unchanged; fewer
  accumulator register-file bytes per MAC is a proposed mechanism, not an isolated energy measurement.
  *(field, E18)* In one bf16 grouped GEMM with 256×256 tiles at the power cap, the
  swap raised the clock from 1.37–1.40 GHz (a recorded baseline) to 1.667 GHz and cut the Down projection's
  dispatch time 10.8% (the scored gain over both projections was +9.2%), while cycles per dispatch rose 8% and
  MFMA utilization fell from 84% to 77%.
  `SQ_VALU_MFMA_BUSY_CYCLES` was bit-identical across the swap. These observations are consistent with a
  clock/power effect, but do not isolate register-file energy or establish a general atom preference; that
  causal attribution remains pending.
  - **Rank atoms on wall time and energy, never on utilization counters.**

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § mainloop §5.

## 6. K tails inside the kernel

Turbo's fp8 kernel accepts any K ≥ 129 without a padding copy; its MXFP4 kernel needs K % 64 == 0, and
its MXFP8 kernel needs K % 128 == 0 and K ≥ 256.
An over-read past K is legal only when every term it contributes has a factor that is exactly zero by
construction. The three ways to get that zero:
- **K-contiguous operands** (stored `[·, K]`, as in NT). Run `ceil(K/128)` iterations. A partial last block over-reads into the
  next row, not past the descriptor, so zero A's out-of-range K bytes in registers (`mask_a_tail`,
  GH:1551-1577; FP8:362, 384, 2712-2717). This relies on quantized operands containing no NaN encodings.
- **K-row operands** (stored `[K, ·]`: B in NN, A and B in TN). The buffer descriptor's `num_records` bound makes out-of-range loads return
  zero.
- **MX formats.** The packed E8M0 scale is zero past K, so the tail terms are scaled by 2⁻¹²⁷ twice and
  underflow to exactly zero, provided the tail bytes hold no NaN or Inf encoding: FP4 and FP6 have none, FP8
  and BF8 do (`../hardware/gfx950/cdna4/ch07_matrix_arithmetic_instructions.md`, Table 30). Drop a 128-K sub-step that is
  entirely padding rather than computing it.
- Row strides that are not a multiple of the 128 B cache line cost bandwidth even when the tail is
  correct. See `datapath.md` §10.

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § mainloop §6.

## 7. Occupancy and allocation knobs

- 8-wave candidates race `waves_per_eu=2` with different AGPR budgets: Turbo's NT table lists
  32, 48 and 64 (`_NT_CANDIDATES`, FP8:3193).
- **Reach a register tier by shortening A's live range, not by a hint.** When A's registers set the occupancy tier,
  read A from LDS in 16-row groups one to three ahead of their MFMAs instead of a whole K tile ahead. On fused-MoE
  fp8 × MXFP4 expert GEMMs: 202 → 168 VGPRs (2 → 3 waves per SIMD) and 7.6–7.9% off the call, where
  `waves_per_eu=3` on the old loop spilled 210 VGPRs and ran 2.4× slower *(field, E23)*; 202 → 148 VGPRs and
  −6.1/−6.8% MoE time *(field, E22)*; 146 → 122 VGPRs, after which `waves_per_eu` 4 built at 128 VGPRs with no spill
  where it had spilled 19–43 *(field, E21)*.
- **Fully unrolling a short K loop pays only with VGPR headroom.** *(field, E19)* At 12–24 K steps:
  ~1–5% faster on ~100-VGPR tiles, ~40% slower on one 256-VGPR tile (spills 9 → 59) and about 1% slower on another (its ISA was not read).
  *(field, E34)* At m 256–4096 on bf16: at N=128, K=6144 unrolling together with a new K-start rotation took m=1024
  from 10.21 to 10.01 µs, and unrolling alone tied at m=512 and lost 0.7% at m=2048 (13.95 against 13.85); at
  N=3584, K=512, m=4096 a 244-VGPR tile without spills gained only with the next fragments prefetched (16.70 against
  16.79 µs; 22.05 unrolled without the prefetch); at N=2048, K=2048, m=256 it lost (8.46 against 8.13).
- **Two loop bodies in one launch can spill at the seam.** *(field, E35)* In a persistent bf16 kernel (N=28672,
  K=512, m=2048) the lane values a tail body derived from the thread id were computed before the head loop and kept
  live across it: 256 VGPRs, 13 spilled. Building the tail body after the head loop, from an opaque copy of the
  thread id, gave 238 VGPRs, no spill, and 5.7% at that m.
- The 4-wave whole loop runs at `waves_per_eu=1` and uses the full register file (FP8:1992). FP4 also sets
  `amdgpu-agpr-alloc=256` (FP4:3095).
- Arch VGPRs and AGPRs share one 512-entry file per SIMD. Allocation is in granules of 8, and the
  occupancy tiers are 64/72/80/96/128/168/256 total registers (8 down to 2 waves per SIMD).
  Arch registers are rounded up to 4 before the AGPRs are added: 101 arch + 21 AGPR is 125 total.
  FlyDSL's guide has the same model with a worked VGPR estimate for a `preshuffle_gemm` tile
  (`../flydsl/guides.md` § gemm-optimization (FlyDSL's §10)).

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § mainloop §7.

## 8. FlyDSL's own GEMM kernels (v0.3.2): what to know when calling or tuning them

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § mainloop §8.

## 9. Throughput arithmetic

```
TFLOP/s = 2·M·N·K / t
bytes   = M·K·a_bytes + N·K·b_bytes + M·N·c_bytes  (+ scales)
```

The ridge is `peak / 8 TB/s`: about 312 FLOP/B for bf16 and 625 for fp8 (vendor theoretical dense peaks at
MI355X clocks: 2.5 PFLOP/s bf16/fp16, 5 PFLOP/s fp8, 10 PFLOP/s MXFP4/MXFP6; 8 TB/s HBM). With N and K much larger than M, a GEMM's intensity is about
M FLOP/B (bf16) or 2M (fp8). Compare against the best kernel on the same box, never against the
datasheet peak. Dense fp8 on realistic data runs at the power cap, so a reduction in register-file or LDS
traffic can show up as clock rather than as fewer cycles (§1, §5).

FlyDSL's guide gives the same formulas with per-dtype byte counts, including MX scales
(`../flydsl/guides.md` § gemm-optimization (FlyDSL's §8.1–§8.2)), and the rule of thumb "M ≤ 512 is memory-bound" (§8.3). The ridge
above puts the crossover nearer M ≈ 300 on gfx950 for both bf16 and fp8, and only when N and K are much larger
than M; compute the intensity for your shape rather than using either number.

## 10. Reading the ISA

- Count instructions inside the hot loop's label range only. Compare them with the plan: MFMAs per phase,
  `ds_read`s per fragment, `buffer_load … lds` per fill, and one `s_waitcnt`/`s_barrier` per phase.
  FlyDSL's guide gives the expected per-tile counts for `preshuffle_gemm` and target ratios such as "MFMA ≥ 40%
  of the loop" (`../flydsl/guides.md` § gemm-optimization (FlyDSL's §9)). Use the ratios to spot a loop body far from its plan, not
  to rank changes: *(field, E20)* deleting 7.4% of a hot loop's instructions, all SALU and `s_nop`, gained 0% on one A6W4 GEMM (the same edit laid A out wave-major in LDS; LDS, VMEM-load and wait counts were unchanged)
  (`attribution.md` §4).
- Check `.agpr_count`, `.vgpr_count`, `.amdhsa_next_free_vgpr` and the scratch size after every
  register-plan or attribute change (§4).
- For a whole-loop kernel, check that the back edge has its `s_cmp` and that no compiler `s_waitcnt`
  sits between the asm phases.

In FlyDSL (`FLYDSL_DUMP_IR=1` dumps the IR and the final ISA): `../flydsl/gemm.md` § mainloop §10.

## 11. Narrow N at M 256–4096: K over waves, each with a private LDS ring

Measured on three bf16 tasks: N=64/K=4096 at M256–4096, N=128/K=6144 at M256–2048,
and N=256/K=6144 at M256–1024. The starting path was recorded as `torch.matmul`;
its actual library dispatch was not bound to the timing records. A one-round grid
(`grid_pricing.md` §1) leaves each workgroup a small output tile and the whole K. The port gives each
workgroup one tile and splits K over its KW waves: each wave streams its slice through its private LDS-DMA ring,
waits on its own `vmcnt` and runs no `s_barrier` in the K loop. The fp32 partials meet in LDS,
are added in wave order and rounded once; bitwise repeat checks cover the tested configurations only. *(field, E26)*
The port from AKLR's `gemm_n512_k4096` kernel (`../cases/bf16_k4096_splitk_hgemm.md`) and its accompanying
tuning gained +29.9%, +26.9% and +11.9%, respectively, over each recorded round's parent
(N=128 was iteration 2, not iteration 1). No arm isolated K-over-waves alone; it fell with M at N=128 (m=256
+54.7%, m=2048 +8.0%) and N=256 (m=1024 +1.5%) but held at 25–34% over every m at N=64.

What held inside it:
- **BK = 128 (256 B per bf16 row).** *(field, E27)* At N=64 on the ported tiles it beat BK 64 at m 256–2048 (m=256
  5.94 against 6.17 µs, m=2048 8.33 against 8.61) and tied at m=4096 (11.71 against 11.68); at N=128, m=2048
  14.46–14.52 against 15.95 or more for BK 64 and 17.41 for BK 256. The delivered tables keep BK 64 at N=64's m=2048
  (after a retile) and m=4096 fold, and at N=256's m=1024.
- **Race the ring depth for each row.** The delivered rows use two or three stages per wave, except N=64's
  four-stage BK-64 row at m=2048 and its separate m=4096 fold path. Each wave has its whole ring in flight
  with no barrier to drain, unlike the shared ring of `small_m.md` §5. *(field, E28)* The 2026-11 FlyDSL 0.3.2
  history records N=64, BK 64 with 6–8 stages reading as with 4–5 (within 0.3% at m 256–2048), and m=4096 at
  3 or 5 stages 11.73 against 11.65 µs; at N=128, m=256, 3 stages with UNROLL 6.00 against 5.73 for 2,
  and at m=2048 BK 64 with 5–6 stages 13.17–13.35 against 12.99 for BK 128 with 3; N=256 moved m=256 and 512
  to 2 stages in a kept round (+2.25%, with new K starts). These are historical readings, not new exact-number reproductions.
  *(field, E37)* At N=128, m=256, the original iter-007 builder with the recorded S3+UNROLL configuration was
  4.025% slower than S2 (CI +3.980% to +4.070%); S2+UNROLL was equivalent to S2 within ±0.3%
  (−0.011%, CI −0.049% to +0.027%), so this does not establish a standalone UNROLL penalty.
  *(field, E38)* At N=64, m=4096, the original iter-002 private-wave builder with only STAGES changed made S3
  and S5 respectively 0.994% and 0.835% slower than S4 (CIs +0.949% to +1.039% and +0.787% to +0.884%).
  Both checks reconstruct configurations on the original builders: the discarded candidate scratch sources and
  historical absolute times were not recovered/reproduced. The N=64 comparison is not against today's delivered fold dispatch;
  neither check establishes a general two-/three-stage rule or validates the other historical rows.
- **More K waves than the delivered count lost.** *(field, E29)* N=128, m=256: 12 waves 5.98–6.04 against 5.52–5.54
  µs for 8; N=64, m=2048: 8 waves 8.01–8.46 against 7.24 for 4; N=64, m=1024: 16 waves at BK 64 5.77 against 5.37
  for 8 at BK 128. Fewer did not win either: at N=64, m 256–1024 8 waves tied with the port's 4 and were kept, and at
  N=128, m=512 8 beat 4 (7.82 against 7.94 µs).
- **Spread the fold over every thread.** *(field, E30)* At N=256, all 256 threads folding 1–4 columns each in wave
  order, with packed stores, in place of wave 0 folding, in a round that also built the C descriptor in the prologue
  (not timed apart): +2.15%; a padded row-major fold tile +0.61% more.
- Race, do not adopt *(field, E31)*: issuing the next tile's DMA before the wait (`lgkmcnt(0)`, issue,
  `vmcnt((S − 1) · loads)`) came with BK 128 in a +9.3% round at N=256 (not timed apart), read up to 5% slower at N=128
  (m=256) and was not shown correct at N=64; giving wave w the K tiles w, w + KW, … in place of a contiguous
  slice paid 1.1% at N=256, m 512–1024 and lost at N=64 and N=128; refilling a slot as soon as its fragments were
  read lost at N=128 and N=256.

At these M the next levers were a K split across workgroups as well (`grid_pricing.md` §2) and
kernel-argument preload (`grid_pricing.md` §6). At N 1024–2048 a K split
did not decide large M (`../cases/bf16_k4096_splitk_hgemm.md` § Counter-signals).
