# Pricing a GEMM's grid and tile

> costs, and what a structural change could return at most. Do that arithmetic first.

## Route here when
- You are choosing `tile_m` / `tile_n`, or deciding whether to widen or narrow a tile.
- A small-M or ragged shape sits far from roofline and the loop itself looks fine.
- You are considering split-K, stream-K, a tail/boundary body, or a K-padding change.
- You are about to build a structural change and want its ceiling first.

**Somewhere else if:** the loop structure is the question → `mainloop.md`; wave placement,
XCD order, scheduling hints or the epilogue → `schedule_and_locality.md`; the arguments of a
shipped kernel → the entry points in `../flydsl/gemm.md` § INDEX Kernel map, and aiter's FlyDSL bf16 rows →
`small_m.md`.

FlyDSL's guide starts the tile choice from `preshuffle_gemm`'s constraints and a table by M
(`../flydsl/guides.md` § gemm-optimization (FlyDSL's §1.3–§1.5)), and its checklist asks for enough blocks to fill the GPU (§13).
This card is the arithmetic behind "enough": dispatch rounds, last-round fill, and what split-K or a different
tile can return.

## 1. Count workgroups and dispatch rounds — before any profile

```
tiles      = ceil(M/tile_m) * ceil(N/tile_n) * split_k
slots      = NCU * wg_per_cu                      # NCU = 256 on gfx950; query it
rounds     = ceil(tiles / slots)
last_round = tiles - (rounds - 1) * slots
eff        = tiles / (rounds * slots)             # fraction of CU slots busy over the launch
```

`wg_per_cu` comes from the occupancy arithmetic (gfx950: 512 registers per SIMD in granules of 8,
160 KiB LDS and 32 wave slots per CU; `W` = waves per workgroup; `regs_per_wave` is the arch VGPRs rounded up
to 4 plus the AGPRs, `mainloop.md` §7; LDS is allocated in 1280-byte blocks):

```
waves_per_simd = min(8, floor(512 / round_up(regs_per_wave, 8)))
wg_per_cu      = min(floor(4 * waves_per_simd / W), floor(163840 / round_up(lds_bytes_per_wg, 1280)), floor(32 / W))
```

A register-heavy GEMM is usually 1, which makes `slots = 256`.

How to read it:

| Reading | What it means | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| `tiles < NCU` | every workgroup walks all of K serially; latency is set by K, not M | split K, or shrink the tile |
| `last_round == slots` (`eff ≈ 1`) | no idle slot to recover; intensity is the limit | **widen** the tile, to one that still fills whole rounds |
| `last_round < slots` | CUs idle through the last round | **narrow** the tile (or split) so the last round fills |

These directions were measured on compute- or feed-bound tiles at large M (E1–E3). On the listed small-M read-once B configurations
(`small_m.md` §2), enlarging the grid did not pay; idle CUs alone do not establish recoverable bandwidth.
Other tiles and configurations still need measurement. The withdrawn 256-versus-288 comparison in
`small_m.md` §3 is not evidence for a universal one-full-round optimum.

**At M 256–4096 the delivered bf16 kernels launched no more workgroups than CUs, one full round wherever the tile
count allowed it.** *(field, E34)* On eight bf16 GEMMs (N 64–28672, K 512–6144, each started from hipBLASLt) every delivered
configuration launched 224 or 256 workgroups (counted from the delivered tile tables); only N=7168 at m=4096 (448
tiles) and N=28672 at m ≥ 1024 walked more tiles than that on a persistent grid of at most 256. Leaving the round
lost both ways *(field, E35)*: two rounds of narrower tiles (N=2048, m=4096: 37.13 against 30.35 µs; N=3584, m=4096:
19.60 against 16.32; N=64, m=2048 on 512 workgroups: 9.68 against 8.61), and half a round of wider ones (N=2048,
m=2048 on 128 workgroups: +7.4 and +7.7 µs, against 19.8 µs for the kernel). At N=7168, m=512 a 128×256 persistent
build on 112 workgroups read 12.46 against 8.09, but the same build also lost 15–18% at m=1024 on a full round, so
that loss cannot be put on the half round alone. At narrow N the round fills with tiles smaller than the MFMA:
*(field, E36)* at N=64, 8×8 and 16×8 output tiles (the MFMA's extra rows and columns alias rows already loaded;
only the real ones are stored) took m=256 and 512 from 64 and 128 workgroups to 256 (estimated from the tiles) and
gained 35.4% and 15.4%.

Narrowing to fill a partial last round paid on an MXFP4 training GEMM (E3 below), but on two bf16 GEMMs at M
256–4096 it lost in all six cases tried: *(field, E37)* at N=7168, K=512, 224-wide tiles that took m=2048 from 224 to
256 workgroups (8 waves in uneven 4/3 column clusters) read 20.71–21.04 against 17.38 µs, and the same with the C
store dropped (14.887 both), so the loss was in the store; at m=4096 (448 to 512 tiles) 37.5–38.5 against 31.7; at
N=28672, 224-wide tiles read 14.99 / 22.22 / 38.22 / 65.67 against 14.71 / 18.55 / 34.22 / 57.89 µs at m=256 / 512 /
1024 / 2048. Race it.
Widening full rounds pays even at the cost of a pipeline stage. *(field, E1)* On a feed-bound bf16 GEMM, halving the
rounds with taller tiles (3 → 2 stages to fit LDS) gained 7–8%: each CU streams fewer A+B bytes.
*(field, E2, E3)* On related MXFP6/MXFP4 GEMM kernels, widening `tile_n` 256→384 on forward shapes was worth
+14.6% on a six-shape score by ablation; narrowing 256→192 gained on exactly the 6 of 12 backward shapes whose last round was
partial and on none of the others (+16% where the last round filled 144 of 256 CUs, +4–6% where it filled 128).

*(field, E4)* A ragged last round can flip the XCD order: grouping won ~7% with a near-full last round and lost 2–6% at
2% more M (12-tile last round); running those rows as a second small-tile launch kept the grouped head (~4% net).
*(field, E5)* On another kernel that head + tail pair lost ~4% to one launch of shorter tiles filling the last round:
race both.

*(field, E6)* Small-M example: bf16 NT, N=6016, K=7168, tile 128×128, `split_k=1` gives
`ceil(6016/128) = 47` workgroups for every M ≤ 128. The kernel ran ~112 µs flat from M=8 to M=112,
while a split-K library kernel ran ~32 µs at M=8. The grid alone explains it — read the launched grid
from a trace before reading any counter.

The usual rule of thumb, "≥1024 workgroups and a multiple of 8", is not sufficient: 1152 tiles at one
workgroup per CU needs five estimated dispatch rounds, with 128/256 workgroups in the last
round (4.5 full-round equivalents); this is a grid arithmetic estimate, not measured residency.

A narrower tile also costs reuse: LDS/global reads per tile scale with `tile_m + tile_n`, MFMA work with
`tile_m · tile_n`. A geometry change that helps one shape moves others the other way, so evaluate it
across the whole shape set you are scored on.

## 2. Split-K: gate on wave quantization, then price the reduce

**Gate.** Propose a split `s` only if `eff(tiles · s) > eff(tiles) + 0.05`; on ties take the smaller
`s`, because partial-sum bytes and reduce traffic scale with `s`. Keep `s = 1` in the candidate set and
choose by measurement with a margin, so a split can never regress a shape. "Few tiles" is only one case
of this gate — a grid that is full but ragged (1.5 or 3.5 rounds) qualifies too.

The gate prices a split that adds workgroups. **At a full round a split can instead keep the workgroup count and
widen the tile**. The estimated logical operand loads **per workgroup** are
(64 + 64) · K/4 against (32 + 32) · K, not loads per output. For a 64×64 final output,
32×32/split1 and 64×64/split4 both launch four workgroups: operand elements per final
output per K are 1/16 versus 1/32 (per partial output, 1/16 versus 1/128).
These counts do not establish HBM traffic or a speedup; `eff` does not see this reuse trade-off, so race it. *(field, E38)* On narrow-N bf16 GEMMs at a full round of 256
workgroups, each folded in the same launch (`wait_free_fold.md`): at N=64, K=4096, m=4096, 64×64 tiles with split 4
replaced 32×32 tiles with split 1 — single driver runs read about 10.99 → 10.41 µs. The whole round's
ladder reported +1.9% at m=4096 and +0.22% [−0.77, +1.21] over five Points; the fold-deletion arm was
not_separable, with no isolated cost. Giving each tile's counter 256 B spacing reported +4.3%
there (9.99–10.03 µs) in a later round against a different parent; at N=256, K=6144, 32×32 tiles with split 2 replaced 16×32 at m=512 (8.77–8.79 → 8.37,
then 7.95–7.97 µs with exchange arrival and the owner's partial kept in registers) and 64×64 with split 4
replaced 32×32 at m=1024. Those rounds also changed rotation/PRO; their gains are not split-alone effects. It lost at N=128,
K=6144, m=2048 (14.37 µs at best against 13.06–13.08), at N=64, m=1024 (6.98 against 5.61) and at N=256, m=256
(6.46 against 6.29–6.31). At N=64, m=2048 it read 7.40 against the session's starting 7.52 and later 7.51 against a
re-timed 7.48 while the machine drifted, and failed the keep gate.

**Price.** The split recovers at most the idle part of the launch, `t · (1 − eff)`. The reduce costs
roughly `(s · M · N · partial_bytes + M · N · out_bytes) / BW`. If the reduce costs more than the idle
time it recovers, no split wins. `partial_bytes` can be 3: fp32 rounded to a 16-bit significand, 4 values in
3 dwords (~7% faster at M=893 with split 7, slower where partials were a small share of the bytes
*(field, E7)*), or 2: four 14-bit integers sharing one power-of-two scale, peak error 0.65–0.68 of the contract's
bound against torch's 0.65–0.67, 0.5–2% faster than the 3-byte form at M 256–512 in single readings *(field, E33)*;
gate it on accuracy. M=4096, N=2880, K=32768 on 256×256 tiles (192 tiles, one round,
`eff` = 0.75): with N and K fixed, that grid took 9.8% more time per tile than a 252-tile grid (`eff` = 0.98)
*(field, E32)*, so filling the round would save an estimated ~15 µs, while an `s=4` bf16 reduce costs an
estimated ~42 µs ⇒ `s=1` is correct; the autotuner that picked it was right.

**How Primus-Turbo implements it** (main `7615a5a2`, files under `primus_turbo/flydsl/gemm/`):
- The gate above is Turbo's MXFP4 gate. `_mxfp4_wave_eff = tiles / (ncu · ceil(tiles/ncu))`; no split
  when `eff > 0.95` or `K < 2048`; a split must raise `eff` by more than 0.05; the race gets `s = 1`
  plus the two best splits (`_ksplit_candidates`, `gemm_mxfp4_kernel.py:3489-3511`).
- **Reduce with pairwise `torch.add(out=)` launched after the GEMM**, not inside it (not at small M:
  `small_m.md` §4). It "runs at the pure write floor where
  `sum(dim=0)` reaches half of it, and the reduce is a sixth of a split launch -- the fold's form decides
  whether a split pays at all" (`_fold_mxfp4_partials`, `gemm_mxfp4_kernel.py:3540-3546`).
- **A bandwidth reduce beats an atomic-fused one** here, "since same-address HBM atomics serialise"
  (`gemm_mxfp4_kernel.py:4536-4538`). Atomic split-K is also not bitwise reproducible.
- **MXFP8 splits only the tail round.** `k_split = NCU / tail` when the tail divides the CU count, with
  at least 16 K iterations per slice; head and tail must both be whole rounds (`_mx_ksplit`,
  `gemm_mxfp8_kernel.py:654-672`). *(field, E8)* A uniform split netted out at zero.
- **Dense fp8 TN splits one window.** Only the last partial round's `rem` tiles are sliced s ways
  (s ∈ {2, 3, 4}), choosing the s with the shortest window time (rounds × K/s; the smaller s on a tie) (`_dense_tn_split`,
  `gemm_fp8_kernel.py:1857-1872`). At s=2 the two slices hand off through a flag accessed at system
  scope (`sc0 sc1`) inside the GEMM, so no reduce kernel is launched (`_tn4_handoff_wait`,
  `gemm_fp8_kernel.py:1325`). That hand-off is a wait between workgroups; in your own kernel, fold by arrival
  instead (below).

Refinements, in the order they usually pay:
- **Tail split.** Split only the tiles of the ragged last round. Makespan matches a uniform split, but
  partial bytes cover only the tail. If the whole-wave part and the tail are two launches on one stream
  they run back to back, so **each must be whole rounds by itself** — otherwise the idle round has only
  moved (e.g. 3.5 rounds → 3 + 1 = 4). It lets a wider tile run whole rounds: *(field, E9, E10)* one round of
  256×256 plus a one-round split-K tail beat a near-full two-round launch of 160-row tiles by ~8%.
- **Stream-K** when you want the idle slots without a full reduce: only boundary tiles need a fixup.
- The split must cut K into whole K-blocks the kernel accepts; shipped kernels assert their own
  constraints (for aiter's bf16 HGEMM split-K, `../flydsl/gemm.md` § small_m §4).
- If the scoring harness rejects GPU work from kernels you did not write, the reduce has to be your own
  kernel in the same language, not a framework op.
- **Or reduce in the same launch, without any workgroup waiting for another**: each split publishes its partial and
  counts in on its tile's counter, and the split that arrives last folds every partial in split order, which is
  bitwise reproducible for a correct fixed-order fold (`small_m.md` §4). Historical counter-free implementations
  tagged their partials and folded on matching peer tags. Their tests do not prove that some split must observe
  all publications or that stale matching tags are impossible; this is not a validated drop-in replacement for
  per-call initialization (`wait_free_fold.md` § Folding without a counter: launch-tagged slots). Forms that wait — reducer workgroups polling their tile's
  flags, or every split summing a share of the tile once all have arrived — rely on the whole grid being resident
  and can fail on a stream limited to part of the CUs. The counter's fold runs on one CU, so race it against a
  separate reduce kernel per shape.

**The reduce kernel itself.** It has many more workgroups than CUs, so occupancy is not its limit; the
number of waves per workgroup only decides whether the sum crosses waves (barriers and LDS round-trips).
Try one wave per workgroup first. *(field, E14)* An attention decode's combine kernel, written in Triton, went
from 4 waves to 1: `s_barrier` 5→0, time −3.7…−6.7%. One wave stops paying where each output merges many
partials: race wider workgroups there (`../attention/decode_split_kv.md` §1). A changed reduction tree
is not bit-identical to the old one — gate it against an independent reference, not old-vs-new max diff.

## 3. Asymmetric operand widths: the best tile is not square

Per K element, a workgroup moves `tile_m · A_row_bytes + tile_n · B_col_bytes` to produce
`tile_m · tile_n` MACs:

```
traffic_per_MAC = A_row_bytes / tile_n + B_col_bytes / tile_m
```

Under an accumulator cap `tile_m · tile_n ≤ C`, this is minimized at

```
tile_m : tile_n = B_col_bytes : A_row_bytes
```

With equal operand widths (bf16×bf16, fp8×fp8) that is square, which is where the square-tile habit comes
from. With MXFP6 A (96 B per 128-K row) and MXFP4 B (64 B per 128-K column) the optimum is
`tile_m : tile_n = 2 : 3`, e.g. 256×384. *(field, E15, E16)* 256×384 beat 256×256 on each of the four shapes it
was tried on: by 3.7%, 6.4% and 6.9% where both tiles ran whole rounds, and by 11.2% where it also turned 4.5
rounds into 3; 128×512 lost 13.9%.

Then check two things before building it:
- **Divisibility.** `N % tile_n == 0` on your shapes. Non-power-of-two widths (192, 384) often divide model
  dimensions of the form `3·2^k` better than 512 does.
- **Accumulator placement.** A wide tile can exceed the 256-dword AGPR file per lane; see
  `schedule_and_locality.md` §7.

*(field, E17)* On two shapes run at `tile_m = 128`, widening only `tile_n` (128×256 → 128×384, which the traffic
formula ranks better) made them 4–9% slower; *(field, E18)* the ratio's own tile, 256×384, cut the same two
shapes' time by 16–19% (one other setting changed with it). Test the tile the ratio gives, not the old `tile_m`
with a new `tile_n`. The ratio tells you where to look, not what will win.

## 4. Occupancy moves in workgroup-sized steps

The register tier gives waves per SIMD (`waves_per_simd` in §1). A workgroup's waves
must all be resident on one CU, so the reachable occupancy is quantized by workgroup size:

```
waves_per_cu = floor(4 * waves_per_simd / W) * W    # W = waves per workgroup
```

With an 8-wave workgroup only 2/4/6/8 waves per SIMD are reachable: cutting from 128 to 96 registers
(per-SIMD tier 4 → 5) buys nothing. Align a register-reduction target to a reachable tier before chasing
it.

**At M 256–4096, the two-workgroups-per-CU builds tried on four bf16 GEMMs all lost to the incumbent kernels, but
only N=28672 timed a one-per-CU control on the same tile, and there two per CU won.** *(field, E39)* At N=7168,
K=512 18–25% slower (m=2048, 4096; tile not recorded); at N=6144, K=1536 21.45 against 15.10 µs (m=512) and 25.84
against 21.08 (m=1024) on smaller tiles; at N=28672, K=512 128×128 tiles at two per CU read 14.87–162.57 against
12.42–110.36 µs for the canonical 256-wide tiles over m 256–4096, and 18.10–234.98 at one per CU; at N=128, K=6144,
m=2048 15.49–17.92 against 12.96.

The compiler's `; Occupancy:` comment in the ISA does **not** apply this quantization. Example:
`llc -mcpu=gfx950` reports a kernel using 96 VGPRs with `amdgpu-flat-work-group-size=512,512` as
occupancy 5; the CU can hold only two such workgroups, i.e. 4 waves per SIMD.

## 5. K granularity: the MFMA decides what a K-tail can save

The MFMA's K is a hard granule. A tail body that skips K padding saves instructions only if

```
ceil(K_real / inst_k) < ceil(K_pad / inst_k)
```

`K_real = 2880`, `K_pad = 2944`, `inst_k = 128` gives 23 and 23 — the tail body saves no MFMA, only the
last iteration's feed bytes. Confirm the granule from counters: `SQ_INSTS_MFMA` should equal
`M·N·K / (m·n·k of the instruction)`.

A bigger MFMA shape is not a throughput lever. *(field, E19)* On gfx950 with fp8 A and B, measured on a grouped
GEMM, `v_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4` occupies the matrix pipe exactly twice as long as
`v_mfma_scale_f32_16x16x128_f8f6f4` (`SQ_VALU_MFMA_BUSY_CYCLES / SQ_INSTS_MFMA` = 64 vs 32), so pipe time per
FLOP is unchanged; it needs 4× the accumulator registers per instruction and leaves fewer independent
accumulation chains to hide dependencies. Swapping only the main-loop MFMA of that grouped GEMM was 0.8–3.0%
slower on 12 of 12 shapes. Use the larger shape to fix K granularity, not to go faster, or to fit a tile in the
register file: *(field, E45)* on a bf16 GEMM (N=6144, K=1536, m=4096) a 256×384 tile spilled in its K loop with
16×16×32 MFMAs (256 VGPRs, 54 `scratch_` instructions, in a timing build that stored C directly) and fitted with
32×32×16 and C staged through LDS in two halves (256 VGPRs, no scratch), at 67.08 µs against the library's 63.9–64.1;
issuing the copies after the first K slice and a row-pair swizzle brought it to the library's time (63.86–63.90
against 63.94 µs, 254 VGPRs). 32×32×16 tiles lost at m 512–2048.

Whether an instruction exists on the target is a five-second check:
`echo '<instruction>' | llvm-mc -arch=amdgcn -mcpu=gfx950 -show-encoding`.

## 6. Fit the per-tile fixed cost before polishing the loop

At fixed M and N, sweep K and fit

```
t_tile = a · n_kblocks + F
```

`F` — prologue, epilogue, tail peel, address and descriptor setup, drain — is paid once per tile, and its
share `F / (a · n_kblocks + F)` grows as K shrinks. Across a shape table it usually explains the TF/s
ranking better than any other variable. *(field, E20, E21)* `F` = 2.21 K-blocks of 256: an estimated 16% of tile
time at K=2944 (11.5 blocks), 1.7% at K=32768, and the table's TF/s order was essentially the inverse of that
share. By the fit, removing one K-block of `F` is worth ~4–5% over that table — a projection, not a measurement,
but already larger than the 1–2% that swizzle and candidate-table changes returned *(field, E22)*.

Kernel-argument preload (`small_m.md` §6) trims `F` at any M: *(field, E23)* −0.2 to −0.6% at M ≈ 900–16k, not only at decode M.
*(field, E40)* At M 256–4096 the ablation rows that carried it paid +0.7% to +2.8% on each of eight bf16 GEMMs
(several bundled other changes: an XCD remap at N=256, a constant tile map at N=3584, a new m=2048 tile route at
N=2048; at N=7168, K=512 +1.0% at m=4096 to +4.8% at m=256), but at N=28672, K=512, m=2048 it
was slower in every pair (55.90–56.31 against 55.26–55.74 µs) with only the preload block changed in the ISA: time
it per M bucket.

Two traps when reading such a table:
- **Compare absolute µs, not TF/s, across padded shapes.** TF/s counts useful FLOPs, so padding waste
  shows up as "efficiency" instead of as work done.
- **"Divisible ⇒ fast" is not a rule.** *(field, E24)* K=2816 (11 K-blocks) ran slower than K=2944 padded to 12
  blocks, because an odd block count fell off an unroll-2 pipeline's store-folding path. Before adding a
  shape, evaluate the kernel's own gates (parity of block counts, tail predicates) for it.

## 7. Bound the gain before building: the illegal arm

For any proposal that shortens a wait, removes a transfer or skips work, first build an arm that removes
it entirely — the results are wrong, the time is the ceiling. Prove the arm really compiled in with an
output checksum (an absurd sum shows it did); a "change" that never reached the binary reads as noise.
If the ceiling is below what you need, skip the idea.
- *(field, E25)* Removing the whole first prologue wait bounded the gain at 0.72%, so a half-wait reorganization
  was worth at most an estimated ~0.35% and was not built.

## 8. Boundary variants are not free

Each extra body variant (a quarter-N or quarter-M tail, a half-K body) adds code even when it never runs.
*(field, E26)* On a grouped GEMM, one variant added 739 instructions (+39.5% of the module) and cost 0.32 points
averaged over the four cells measured, all compiled into that module, with VGPR, SGPR and LDS identical across arms — code size alone.

```
net = hit_rate × gain_per_tile × shapes_that_trigger − carry_cost × shapes_in_module
```

Measure the hit rate on the scored input distribution first: a runtime ragged tail can be 0% on balanced
inputs. When a variant does pay, prefer re-assigning waves over computing less — a ragged tile wastes
whole waves pinned to an empty region, and re-tiling the waves (e.g. 2×2 → 4×1) serves the N tail, while
the same body rotated 90° serves the M tail. Write the gate as geometry (`m_tail <= rows_per_wave`), not
as shape constants.

## 9. Pricing an alternative tile shape

A second tile shape trades arithmetic intensity for CU fill. Price both sides before adding it to the race.
- **Operand bytes per output cell are `(bm + bn) / (bm · bn)`.** Turbo's dense fp8 whole loop lets its
  narrower 256×192 tile join the race only when its gain in resident workgroups exceeds its loss in
  intensity: `coverage(rect) / coverage(square) > intensity(rect) / intensity(square)` (`_nt4_geoms`,
  `gemm_fp8_kernel.py:2102-2119`).
- **A narrow tile wins only where its extra tiles still fit in the same number of dispatch rounds**, so
  each round is shorter. Turbo's MXFP4 picks BLOCK_N=192 over 256 only when the 192 grid needs no more
  rounds and its priced time is lower: a k-block at the pessimistic feed ratio `(BM + BN) / (2·BM)`, plus
  the C store the narrow tile can no longer fold (`_mxfp4_pick_block_n`, `gemm_mxfp4_kernel.py:3426-3445`).
  The store penalty was solved from one measured shape; re-derive it for your kernel.
- **Dead quadrants still issue their MFMAs.** The descriptor bound drops only their loads and stores. An
  exact tile (e.g. 192 rows when M divides by 192) therefore shortens every workgroup's own path. Turbo
  adds exact tiles only when they fit in one CU pass and cut the per-workgroup MFMAs per K block
  (`gemm_fp8_kernel.py:2066-2070, 2134-2144`).
- **Work freed on only some workgroups returns less than it looks.** On a power-capped part, idle CUs
  come back as clock for the others, not as wall time (`_nt4_wg_path` docstring, `gemm_fp8_kernel.py:2134`).
- **The race decides, not the plan.** An analytic ranking only orders the builds.

## 10. Persistent tiles per workgroup

- With `tiles_per_wg = ceil(tiles / ncu)`, a tile count between two whole CU passes rounds the resident
  workgroup count down, and the rest of the device never gets a wave. "This, not the tile count, is the
  signal" (`_nt4_resident`, `gemm_fp8_kernel.py:2089-2095`).
- Leftover work ids may repeat the last tile. That is harmless for an overwriting store and wrong for
  beta=1, which needs one tile per workgroup (`epilogue.md` §7).
- Turbo's MXFP4 kernel walks up to 4 tiles per workgroup, and only when `tiles % (ncu · tpw) == 0` and
  K/256 ≤ 56; at longer K the per-tile launch is already amortized (`_MXFP4_TPW_*`,
  `gemm_mxfp4_kernel.py:3467-3485`). Stride the persistent loop by the grid
  (`schedule_and_locality.md` §2).
- **Passing that gate is not a win: race it.** *(field, E27)* A small-M bf16 GEMM at K=256 with 2560 tiles lost
  5.5–12.5% at 2 tiles per workgroup under every store placement (and 1–5% as a two-tile walk of another variant
  of the kernel), though a stores-off probe had priced an estimated ~7% gain.
  *(field, E28)* At K=512 a 1-per-CU grid walking 6–60 tiles each, whose last two K-blocks fill the next tile's stages
  and with no workgroup barrier between tiles (C staged per wave), beat one tile per workgroup by 3–5%.
- **Race a start delay on half of each XCD's workgroups** (`s_sleep` before the first fill when
  `pid // 8` is odd; a few thousand clocks). *(field, E29, E30)* +1–3% at 6–20 tiles per workgroup, null at ~60.
  *(field, E41)* At N=28672, K=512 the best delay count moved with M and with other changes: none at m ≤ 512, 1 at
  m=1024, 5 at m=2048 (58.30–58.41 against 59.85–60.03 for 3) until the XCD order changed and 2 won. At N=7168, m=4096
  (448 tiles: 64 workgroups walk one tile fewer), delaying only those 64 took 31.39–31.54 to 29.57–29.9 µs (+6.1% at
  that m in the ablation); the same delay lost at m=2048 and 1024, one tile each.
- **Cut a partial last round into shorter tail items inside the same persistent launch.** *(field, E42)* At
  N=28672, K=512, m=2048 (896 tiles of 256×256, 3.5 rounds): 768 head tiles plus 256 items of 128 rows, 61.91 →
  59.47 µs back to back (+5.3% at that m in an ablation row that also carried a per-m start-delay choice); at
  m=1024 (1.75 rounds), one head tile and one 192-row tail item per workgroup lost alone (34.09–34.14 against
  33.87–33.96 µs) and paid +6.5% once the start delay was raced with it.
- **In a one-round launch, race dropping the next-tile prefetch the persistent body carries.** *(field, E43)* At
  N=28672, K=512, skipping the last two K-blocks' next-tile DMAs and the last block's wait took m=512 from 20.3 to
  19.2 µs and left m=256 unchanged (15.40–15.48 against 15.40).
- **Keeping B resident in LDS does not pay when B already sits in L2.** *(field, E31)* At K=128 with a sub-MB B, a
  persistent kernel holding each workgroup's B slice gained ~1% at M=16384 and lost 10–22% at M=9397. *(field, E44)*
  At K=512 (N=7168, m=512) keeping the B panel in LDS for two 64-row sub-tiles per workgroup lost 12.5–19.3%; with
  the stores removed it still read 7.37 µs against 6.46 µs for the incumbent with its stores removed, so the loss was
  not in the stores. Whether B already sat in L2 was not measured.

## Verify
- The tile/round table for every scored shape exists before the first build.
- A split or tile change is judged per shape, with `s = 1` / the old tile still in the race.
- A structural change has an illegal-arm ceiling, and the arm is proven live by a checksum.
- The win does not come from one shape while its neighbours regress.

`FlyDSL ?`. The Kimi-K3 forge runs installed `flydsl==0.3.2`. The month is the run's; where the record is a note written
