## Route here when
- The C store, a beta=1 read-back or a fused activation/quantization takes a visible share of the kernel.
- You are choosing a store width, a cross-lane reorder, or an LDS-staged (CShuffle) epilogue.
- An occupancy-1 kernel has an epilogue that nothing overlaps.

## 1. The facts that set the price

- **MFMA output layout.** In a 16×16 accumulator tile, a lane holds 4 consecutive rows of one column, and
  neighbouring columns sit in neighbouring lanes. A naive bf16 store therefore writes 16 lanes × 2 B =
  **32 B per request**.
- **The gfx950 write request is 64 B, not the 128 B cache line.** *(field, E1)* On a grouped fp8 GEMM,
  `TCP_TCC_WRITE_REQ` matched bytes/32 for scalar stores and bytes/64 for paired stores exactly. Widening
  further to `dwordx2` halved the issued store instructions but left the requests unchanged, and wall time got
  0.85 pp worse. So pairing two columns into one dword already reaches the request floor. Wider stores only
  save instructions.
- **Give each workgroup C column blocks that start and end on 128 B lines.** *(field, E2, E3)* The same bytes stored at a
  144 B instead of a 128 B column pitch cost 2–3% at M=24–96; owning a line-aligned 64-column block plus a slice
  of a separate leftover-column strip (B rows fetched to match) read −0.4% to +3.1% per shape, 11 of 13 faster, in
  a round that also changed the C store's cache policy in some M buckets and dropped an epilogue barrier (the
  barrier alone −0.1% to +0.3%).
- **Pairing pays `64 B ÷ (W × 2 B)` for a W-wide fragment.** For 32-wide MFMA fragments, the scalar store
  already covers 64 B, so pairing has no request savings left there. *(field, E4, E5)* It gained +1.3% on a
  grouped fp8 GEMM (a 32×32×64 atom on the transposed 4(M)×2(N) wave grid, the only grid that keeps the
  pairing), against +2.8–5.0% on 16-wide fragments of the same kernel.
- **At the power cap, store savings show up as clock, not as wall time inside a tile.** *(field, E6)* Deleting a
  grouped fp8 GEMM's whole epilogue at the power cap moved a same-process wall probe by 0 ± 1 pp, while the
  benchmark gained. Price store changes with `TCP_TCC_WRITE_REQ` (the mechanism) plus the real benchmark (the
  size), not with an in-process wall probe.

## 2. Decide whether the store matters before changing it

Run three ablations of the epilogue:
1. **Delete the whole store.** This gives the total cost.
2. **Same bytes, fewer segments.** This measures the request cost.
3. **Same segments, fewer VALU instructions.** This measures the issue cost.

Only (1) moving means the store is byte- or bandwidth-bound, and width or reorder work will not help.
*(field, E7)* In one grouped MXFP4 NT GEMM the time changes were (1) −17.7% to −20.3%, (2) +0.8%, (3) −0.5%,
so its store was byte-bound. Check that an ablation arm writes the same `M×N×2` bytes to the same rows.
*(field, E7)* A probe that collapsed four rows into one segment also cut the written bytes about 6×, and read
as a false request win.

*(field, E37)* Historical probes [2026-11, gfx950, FlyDSL 0.3.2] on four bf16 GEMMs at m 512–4096
(none measured at m=256) reported 8–16% from removing the C store (timing only): 13–16% at N=3584,
K=512 (m 1024–4096); 8–12% at N=7168, K=512 (m=512, 1024); at N=2048, K=2048,
removing the store changed time by −1.655/−4.985 µs at m=2048/4096 (the old 8%/16% estimates used
cross-iteration denominators, not paired probe savings); 10% at N=6144, K=1536 (m=4096).
These remain historical readings, not final-build targets.
*(field, E43)* Independent current-source cold-cache pairs [2026-11-06, gfx950, FlyDSL 0.3.2] at all eight
of those M points found **6.322–15.751% less time after deleting only the terminal global C store**:
N=2048, K=2048: 6.604%/8.273% at m=2048/4096; N=3584, K=512: 15.751%/9.903%/8.757% at
m=1024/2048/4096; N=6144, K=1536: 6.322% at m=4096; N=7168, K=512: 11.138%/13.941% at m=512/1024.
The original arm passed the recorded finite-output/reference-tolerance gate; the deletion arm deliberately left
C entirely NaN and is **not a correct optimization**. Existing LDS staging and a side-effect sink for the store
data were retained. Archived ISA summaries preserve the MFMA opcode sequence, LDS read/write opcode histograms
and LDS allocation, with global stores reduced to zero; they do not establish that the full ISA, operands,
scheduling or occupancy stayed unchanged. This is a timing-only net deletion effect, **not attainable optimization
savings, end-to-end gain or an exact physical store-time share**. The four source hashes and the recovered
N=6144 delivery-source scope are listed in E43. These builds and the current ruler neither certify nor refute
the historical 8–16% under different iteration/compile flags/configurations; historical reconstruction remains open.

*(field, E8, E9)* The "best" epilogue does not carry over between shape families. A permlane wide store was
optimal on dense 8192²×4096 (16 KB rows, `N % 256 == 0`). The same store was 0.7–4.1% slower on a grouped MXFP4
NT GEMM with 5888 B output rows.

## 3. Store classes, from free to expensive

FlyDSL's guide describes the two ends (`../flydsl/guides.md` § gemm-optimization (FlyDSL's §7)): a **direct store** from the MFMA
layout, and **CShuffle**, which writes the accumulators to LDS row-major, re-reads them as `(MLane=8,
NLane=32)` after a barrier and stores 4-element vectors, for `tile_n ≥ 128`. Turbo keeps one store class per technique
between those two ends (GH:778-1525). Prefer the cheapest class that reaches the 64 B floor.

| Class | How a lane gets adjacent columns | Cost | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scalar | none: `buffer_store_short` per value, column step in the immediate | baseline, 32 B requests | FlyDSL PS direct store; Turbo `StoreCPerTensor`, GH:778 |
| **Row-permuted feed** | permute the **global rows the B fill fetches** so a lane's two n-fragments become adjacent output columns | **zero instructions**: only the prologue's per-lane global offsets change | `StoreCPerTensorPairCol`, GH:1061; `compute_global_swizzle_pair`, GH:256 |
| DPP pair | `v_cvt_pk_bf16_f32` + one `quad_perm` DPP swap + `v_perm_b32` | 1 cvt + 1 DPP + 1 perm per pair | `StoreCPerTensorPairN`, GH:1113 |
| Row merge | one `v_permlane16_swap_b32` per packed fragment pair moves the second fragment into the other 32-lane half, so one store covers a whole 64 B row run | 1 permlane per pair | `StoreCPerTensorRowN`, GH:1004 |
| Quad/fold | the row permutation folds 4 or 8 columns into one lane: one `dwordx2`/`dwordx4` | offsets only | `StoreCPerTensorQuadN`, GH:1251 |
| Line via LDS | transpose through LDS with `ds_read_b64_tr_b16` into a whole 128 B line per fragment row; scratch borrowed from an operand buffer | LDS traffic + fence | `StoreCPerTensorLineN`, GH:1180 |
| CShuffle | LDS staging, then vector stores | LDS + barriers | FlyDSL A16 `write_cshuffle_vec_to_global`, `c_shuffle_epilog`; Turbo `StoreCPerTensorCShuffle`, GH:1335 |
| Transposed accumulator | swap the MFMA operands so the accumulator holds Cᵀ; two `permlane16_swap`s give 8 contiguous columns, one `dwordx4` | 2 permlanes per 8 columns | FP4 `store_tacc_wide`, FP4:513 |

How to choose:
- **First, see whether the reorder can be an address change.** When the output column is the B operand's
  slow axis (NT: output column = B row), permute B's rows in the G2S fill using the involution
  `W·t + m ↔ 2·m + t` within each `2W`-row block. The fill already takes arbitrary per-lane global offsets,
  and the LDS swizzle key still follows the LDS row, so the reader does not change. *(field, E10)* This gave
  +2.4–2.8% on a grouped fp8 NT GEMM (three token distributions): `buffer_store_short` 160→32,
  `buffer_store_dword` 0→64, and `v_cvt_pk` 160→96. The MFMA, barrier, VGPR and LDS counts were unchanged.
- **When the output column is the operand's fast axis (NN/TN), use the row merge.** The transpose read's
  lane→column map is fixed by hardware, and a 16 B fill chunk holds 16 whole columns, so neither can be
  permuted. Pack each row pair (`v_cvt_pk_bf16_f32`) first, then swap the packed dwords. *(field, E11)* Swapping
  unpacked f32 values on a grouped fp8 GEMM took 64 permlanes and gained +0.13%; swapping packed pairs took 32
  and gained +0.43–0.83% (three token distributions).
  **Price a cross-lane primitive by the output values it moves per instruction.**
- *(field, E12, E9)* On grouped GEMMs of the same family, every other option that paid cross-lane VALU or an LDS round
  trip for a wider store lost: CShuffle −21% on that dgrad NN kernel (−24% on its forward NT), DPP pairing −1.1%
  there and −1.9% on its TN weight-gradient kernel, a transposed-accumulator wide store −0.7 to −4.1% on a grouped
  MXFP4 NT GEMM with nearly the same output row stride. The gains were the free address permutation and the packed-row merge above.
- CShuffle is not only for `tile_n ≥ 128`: race it against the direct store on narrow tiles too. *(field, E13, E14, E15)* At 128–256-wide
  bf16 tiles it can decide the kernel: direct register stores lost 9–50% to it on two kernels (8 B stores where
  the width is recorded); on 96-wide tiles that store 72 columns (80-wide above M=96), direct 8–16 B stores lost
  2–14% to it at M ≥ 56 and were within 2% of it either way at M ≤ 48.
  *(field, E38)* Register-direct versus LDS-staged C stores, and wider versus narrower direct stores, were different
  comparisons on these bf16 kernels at m 256–4096. On grids whose B fill permuted rows so each lane held adjacent columns: at N=7168, K=512 (m ≤ 2048), with A
  first in the MFMA and 16 lanes writing a whole 128 B row, 8 B each, +0.87% over five m (m=256 +2.3%, m=512 +1.6%,
  m 1024–2048 +0.1–0.3%; the permuted 16 B form lost at every m); at N=2048, K=2048 paired-dword stores beat its 2 B
  direct stores by 0.44 and 0.64 µs at m=2048 and 4096, where an LDS-staged 16 B store lost 0.2–0.4 µs; and at N=3584
  on two tiles up to 128 wide (below). The permutation alone did not predict the sign (N=28672 below). It did not win
  on the two-round m=4096 of the N=7168 kernel (29.06–29.28 against 28.98–29.20 µs, overlapping), and lost at N=28672
  (+2 to +16% with the same permutation) and at N=6144, K=1536 (m 256–1024). At N=3584, K=512 it was mixed on tiles
  up to 128 wide: it won at m=256 on 32×112 tiles (5.01 against 5.08 µs; on the 64×64 tile that later replaced
  it, it lost 0.10 µs, and the delivered 64×64 row stages C through LDS) and at m=1024 on 128×128 (−0.09 µs,
  delivered), lost at m=512 on 64×112 (5.95–5.97 against 5.88–5.90 µs). At m 2048–4096 on 128–256 × 224 tiles,
  direct stores together with disabling overlap lost 3.1–7.7 µs; that comparison does not isolate the store path.
- **Feeding CShuffle, swap the MFMA operands:** a lane then holds 4 adjacent columns, so each fragment is one 8 B
  LDS write (64 `ds_write_b16` → 8 `ds_write2_b64` per wave), no cross-lane op. *(field, E16)* +0.3% to +3.2% per
  shape, all 17 faster (the same kept round also gave M=33–60 a single 64×32 row block).

**Instruction-level rules for cross-lane stores**
- A `permlane16_swap` result consumed only by a `buffer_store` (VMEM) needs no `s_nop`. That hazard covers a
  following VALU read (FP4:500-502).
- When a VALU consumes the result, use the `llvm.amdgcn.permlane16.swap` / `permlane32.swap` intrinsics, not inline
  asm. The hazard recognizer cannot see asm, so asm forces an `s_nop` on both sides. *(field, E17)* Switching to the
  intrinsic cut `s_nop` from 412 to 174 in a fused bias + GELU epilogue (683 to 24 with FP6 row quantization fused
  as well).
- Issue all swaps first, then all stores, so the permlanes and the stores are far apart. *(field, E18)* Only the two
  changes together, dropping the hard-coded `s_nop` and the two-phase order, took the count from 80 to 0.
- **Never store the high half of an f32 accumulator as bf16.** That is truncation, not round-to-nearest-even.
  - *(field, E19)* It cost 5.8 dB SNR and made the store slower.
  - Convert with `v_cvt_pk_bf16_f32`, and store the pair's high half with `buffer_store_short_d16_hi` where the
    toolchain can emit it; otherwise it costs one `v_lshrrev_b32`.
- On gfx950, a multi-dword MUBUF VGPR tuple must be 64-bit aligned.

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § epilogue §3.

## 4. Overlap the store with the last MFMAs

At one wave per SIMD nothing overlaps the epilogue unless you put it inside MFMA shadows.
- **8-wave.** Store quadrants c00/c01 between the c10/c11 MFMAs of the last iteration (FP8:383-400).
  MXFP8 laps two quadrants into the last K iteration. "Past 2 the store temporaries outlive an MFMA pair
  and VGPRs spill" (`_MX_EPI_LAP`, MX8:91-93).
- **Whole loop.** Stop the asm loop one phase early and hand the last phase's MFMAs back as SSA values
  (`mainloop.md` §3). Issue them row-tile by row-tile and put each row-tile's store after the
  *next* row-tile's MFMAs. *(field, E20)* Distance 1 was best on a grouped GEMM; 2 and 4 were worse.
  - The hazard recognizer cannot see asm MFMAs. Put a `sched_barrier(0)` before each store group and
    trailing `s_nop`s after the last row-tile. Otherwise a VALU reads a stale accumulator, and only the last
    row-tile is wrong.
  - The ceiling is one K-block of MFMAs. *(field, E20)* That recovered an estimated 10% of the store cost on a
    grouped weight-gradient GEMM with 32 K-blocks per tile (+0.7–1.1%). *(field, E31)* On a grouped dgrad kernel
    whose last window without G2S held 8 MFMAs, it gained +0.02%, within noise.
  - *(field, E39)* On bf16 GEMMs at m 1024–4096, historical compiled-loop comparisons included overlap:
    at N=3584, K=512, staging C one row group at a time through the stage the last K slice freed,
    together with an exact-vmcnt correction, gained +2.5% (m=4096 +7.9%, m=2048 +4.4%).
    Double-buffering that staging together with removing write barriers gained +0.16% more; at N=7168, K=512 slicing the last K block so its stores
    overlap +1.5–1.6% at m=2048 and +0.9–1.0% at m=4096 in the probe (its ablation row, +1.4% over five m, also
    carried barrier-free per-wave C staging at m 256–1024, +3.0% at m=512); at N=6144, K=1536, storing each wave's first 32-row atom row in the last K step,
    removing a scheduling fence and changing SOFF gained +0.33% over five M Points; m=4096 gained +1.45%.
    This is the joint round's result, not overlap alone (two or three early rows lost).
- **Fold the store into a phase with no G2S.** gfx950 has a single in-order `vmcnt` for loads and stores,
  so a store in flight is serialized against operand DMA waits. FP4 therefore puts its fused C store in a
  peeled tail phase that issues no fills, and paces it at `_CRATE` lines per MFMA (FP4:776, 1095-1233,
  1745). Spent accumulators can be recycled as pack registers when the caller never reads them
  (`acc_dead`, FP4:679).
  - *(field, E40)* Moving a persistent bf16 kernel's C store into the next tile's K loop (N=28672, K=512) lost at
    m=4096 (118.7–121.4 against 111.8 µs) and m=1024 (36.8–37.2 against 35.8) and read 57.2–57.7 against 58.0 at
    m=2048 (single driver runs, not paired); it was reverted.

## 5. Cache policy on the store

- **C is write-once: race `nt` (aux=2) and `sc1` (aux=16) against the default.** Turbo stores it `nt` so it does
  not evict the A/B band the L2 tile order keeps (FP8:72-73). *(field, E21)* On a bf16 GEMM with K=128 and N=1536,
  `sc1` won at every M from 8 to 16384 (+3.1% to +20.3% per shape, all 17 faster) and `nt` lost at the largest M.
  *(field, E22)* On another (K=512, M ≈ 35k–340k), `nt` beat `sc1` by 0–10% and the default by 1–17%. At decode M
  (1–128) with K=512 the sign of `sc1` differed between two shapes: *(field, E35)* on N=7168, `sc1` with paired
  16 B stores gained 5.39% [+4.19, +6.60], all 8 M faster, and `sc1` alone was 0.10–0.20 µs faster at every M but
  m=64; the g03-009 seven-point AA review remains open; no current-final completion is claimed.
  *(field, E36)* on N=28672, the historical iter006 readings [2026-11, gfx950, FlyDSL 0.3.2]
  put `sc1` slower than the default at 7 of 8 M in single paired readings (+0.3% to +5.5%, four of them above 1%;
  m=2 −0.4%). These numbers describe that old iteration/store layout, not a verified final-build pattern.
  *(field, E44)* On the delivered-final N=28672, K=512 source `827136159797…` [2026-11-06, gfx950,
  FlyDSL 0.3.2], the original decode dispatch was tested at **all m=1/2/4/8/16/32/64/128**, with C-store
  aux0/2/16 as the only source edit. For fixed seeds 731/1731 respectively, the paired `sc1`-minus-default
  time percentages were: m=1 +2.935%/+10.183%; m=2 +3.037%/+8.472%; m=4 +3.882%/+12.581%;
  m=8 +13.363%/+12.190%; m=16 +0.465%/+0.415%; m=32 +0.433%/+0.577%;
  **m=64 −0.992%/+0.615%**; m=128 +2.195%/+1.916%. All primary simultaneous 95% intervals resolved
  the sign; at m=64 they were [−1.034%, −0.951%] and [+0.561%, +0.669%], so do not pool away the reversal.
  The compiled full ISA matched after removing only C-store cache flags; recorded official-reference/error-bound,
  finite-output, aux-to-default bitwise, alternate-current-stream and negative-control gates passed at all points,
  as did the same-callable/output AA gate. These are observations on **two fixed inputs per M**, with 20 timing
  sessions per seed, not 20 independent inputs. The seeds ran in separate sequential time windows: the reversal
  cannot be attributed to input seed alone, and no input-population policy conclusion follows. This completes
  the current-source observations, not the historical 7/8, m=2 exception or +0.3–5.5% verification; all original
  M points and the historical scope remain retained.
  *(field, E41)* Historical bf16 races [2026-11, gfx950, FlyDSL 0.3.2] at m 256–4096: `sc1` won at N=6144, K=1536 (m=256 10.90 against 11.17 µs with `sc0`;
  at m=1024 `sc1` and `nt` within 0.3%; the default 2.2% slower at m=4096) and at N=7168, K=512 (2.4–2.9% against
  `nt` at m=256, 2048 and 4096 in an early race, tied at m=1024; a later race on the delivered m ≤ 2048 store put
  `sc1` 1–2% ahead at m 256–512 and tied with `nt` at m 1024–2048; the default 5–12% slower at m 256–2048 and 0.8%
  at m=4096); in the historical N=28672, K=512 iter002/003 builds (E41, 2026-11, gfx950, FlyDSL 0.3.2), head `nt`
  was faster at m=1024 and 4096 (35.83 against 36.83, 112.2 against 117.5 µs), m=2048 read nearly equal
  (59.53 against 59.46), and head `sc1` was faster at m=512 (18.53–18.54 against 18.61–18.62 µs).
  Independent cold-cache pairs on the delivered-final source `7b46b25171ea…` (2026-11-06, same N/K,
  gfx950, FlyDSL 0.3.2; original dispatch, head aux2/16 only, tail fixed aux2) instead resolved head `sc1`
  as faster at each of m=512/1024/2048/4096. At m=2048, direction was resolved but the simultaneous 95%
  CI still crossed the fixed ±0.3% equivalence boundary. These final-build results do not invalidate the
  historical readings; persistent-round count alone does not select the policy, and no default arm was tested; at
  N=2048, K=2048 the historical iter016 build (E41, 2026-11, gfx950, FlyDSL 0.3.2) read default/`sc0`
  nearly equal at m=4096 (`nt` +0.6%, `sc1` +1.9%); iter004 read `nt`/default nearly equal at m=512–2048
  (`sc1` not raced there). Independent cold-cache pairs on delivered-final source `138cd2cef48c…`
  (2026-11-06, same N/K, gfx950, FlyDSL 0.3.2; original dispatch, C-store aux0/1/2/16 only) found m=4096
  default/`sc0` equivalent within fixed ±0.3% (`sc0` directionally 0.027% faster), with `nt`/`sc1` slower
  by 0.688%/2.325%. Relative to default, `nt` was 0.496%/1.342% faster at m=512/1024 but 1.256% slower
  at m=2048; none of those three met ±0.3% equivalence. The old near-equality does not guide this final
  build; m=512–2048 `sc1` was recorded but is not used to close the historical clause; at N=3584, K=512 `sc1` paid on LDS-staged row stores (the default
  cost 1.39 µs at m=2048) and went both ways on register-direct stores: it lost at m=256 (+0.44 µs), at m=1024 on a
  64×224 tile (+0.82) and at m=2048 (+1.9 against the default), and won on the delivered m=1024 128×128 row-group
  store (the default +0.76, `nt` +0.24 µs against it). On narrow N (64–256, K 4096–6144) no policy paid on the
  output except `sc1` at N=256, m=512 and 1024 (0.3–0.8% faster before those buckets were split across workgroups,
  and kept on their split-K output store; it lost 1.7% at m=256).
  *(field, E45)* Current-final N=6144, K=1536 (`540ffda92fac…`, audited 2026-11-06, gfx950-targeted compilation)
  covers only m=256/512/1024/4096, two fixed inputs each; m=2048 is absent from the real final dispatch.
  Both seeds support `sc1` faster than `sc0` at m=256 and than default at m=4096; m=512 is observation-only.
  At m=1024, mean per-session 100×(time(nt)/time(sc1)−1) is −0.434645% [−0.467335, −0.401956]
  for seed731 (non-equivalent) and −0.207454% [−0.244206, −0.170701] for seed1731 (equivalent within
  fixed ±0.3%). **Both effects favour `nt`; the equivalence verdict differs, not the sign.** All AA intervals
  passed ±0.15%; the historical 10.90/11.17 µs, 2.2% and old layout remain separate and unverified.
  *(field, E46)* Current-final N=7168, K=512 (`d5171067a306…`, audited 2026-11-06, gfx950-targeted compilation)
  covers m=256/512/1024/2048/4096, two fixed inputs each. All AA intervals passed ±0.15%; both seeds
  support `sc1` faster than default at all five points (per-session default/sc1 effects 3.203–9.924%) and
  faster than `nt` at m=256/512. For time(nt)/time(sc1)−1, m=1024 reverses sign but both seeds are
  equivalent within ±0.3%: seed731 +0.111912% [+0.071354, +0.152469], seed1731 −0.163521%
  [−0.189426, −0.137616]. At m=2048 the effects reverse and **both are non-equivalent**: seed731
  +2.036826% [+1.968119, +2.105533], seed1731 −0.383761% [−0.429174, −0.338349]. The m=4096
  `sc1`/`nt` comparison is observation-only. Neither current-final collection closes the historical claim:
  these results neither certify nor refute E41's early 2.4–2.9%, later 1–2%, or default 5–12%/0.8% readings.
  Seeds ran in sequential windows; do not pool away the differences or attribute them to input seed alone.
- **Give `nt` only to stores that write whole 128 B lines.** Sub-line stores (2 bytes per lane) rely on L2 to merge
  their 32 B pieces into 64 B writes, so `nt` and `sc0` both cost there. *(field, E32)* On a dense MXFP4 NT GEMM, on
  the 10 shapes whose A and B fitted the LLC and C did not, the default policy and `sc0` both lost to `nt` on every
  shape, by up to 6.4%. *(field, E34)* On another dense MXFP4 GEMM, whose A and B also fit the LLC and C did not
  (estimated from the shapes), all eight `sc0`/`nt`/`sc1` combinations of its folded C stores read within 0.56% and
  0.64% on two training shapes, inside the 2.0% spread of the default's own two reads: fitting A and B in the LLC does
  not by itself predict that `nt` pays.
- **Scope bits send even whole-line writes past the per-XCD L2 that merges them.** *(field, E33)* On a grouped
  MXFP4 GEMM whose C stores fill whole lines, `sc1` alone or added to `nt` cost 4–5% on all six weight-gradient
  cells. Turbo uses system scope `sc0|sc1|nt` (aux=19; agent scope is `sc1` alone) only for a beta=1 burst from
  one tile per workgroup that is too large for L2, switching at 26 MiB of C (`_cstore_aux`, FP8:74-77, 1885);
  its comment places that about where the burst stops fitting in L2 beside the operand band.
- **The sign is shape-dependent, so race it.** *(field, E23)* In the MXFP8 GEMM, `nt` cut the wide shapes by 4.6%
  and 3.0% and cost 0.9–1.9% on narrow shapes whose slabs were already L2-resident. It is raced at a 1%
  margin, not pinned (MX8:968-974).
- **Never mark byte-granular scale stores (E8M0) non-temporal.** They rely on L2 merging the write masks.
  - *(field, E24)* In the MXFP8 cast kernels that cost 15–40%.
- Keep split-K partials cached only if the same XCD reduces them; reduced on other XCDs, `sc1` stores (aux=16) were
  *(field, E25)* 2–4% faster. Do not mark partials `nt`: aux 18/19 cost *(field, E26)* 3–6% against aux 17
  (`sc0|sc1`). *(field, E42)* At m=4096 (N=64, K=4096, split 4, the splits presumed on one XCD) aux 16 and 17 tied
  (10.22 µs); after each tile's counter got its own 256 B, aux 18/19 read 10.71–10.72 and the L2-cached aux 0, 1 and 3
  10.79–10.83 against 10.05 with aux 17 (single driver runs): the `sc0|sc1` partials won even with the splits presumed
  on one XCD.

## 6. Bounds without per-column masks

- Rebase the C descriptor per row band in i64 and pin base and `num_records` with `readfirstlane`
  (`make_row_band_resource`, GH:2010). A wide store has no per-column mask, so a whole column span is
  dropped by giving its band 0 records. Store classes that span several fragments require
  `N % tile_n == 0` (`col_safe`).
- When a store is bounded by selecting an out-of-range byte offset (one `v_cndmask` per offset), apply that select
  to the part of the offset that does not depend on the sub-tile, then add the sub-tile row delta.
  *(field, E27)* Otherwise `v_cndmask_b32` went from 14 to 64 in a grouped GEMM's fused epilogue.
- One descriptor per tensor per tile is enough when sub-tiles differ only by a compile-time row offset.
  Carry the row delta in the offset instead of building a descriptor per sub-tile.

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § epilogue §6.

## 7. beta = 1 (accumulate into C)

- Pipeline the read-back: load quadrant i+1 of C while quadrant i's store is in flight (`_store_quadrants`, GH:1528).
  Add in f32 so the result is rounded once.
- **Compile and race against a scratch output.** If building the kernel also runs it, a beta=1 build against the
  caller's C accumulates into it twice. Turbo races at beta=0 and rebuilds the winning configuration with the
  accumulate epilogue (FP8:3008-3027).
- A persistent kernel that repeats its last tile for leftover workgroup ids is fine for overwrite stores
  but double-accumulates at beta=1. Turbo forces one tile per workgroup there.

In FlyDSL: `../flydsl/gemm.md` § epilogue §7.

## 8. Fused epilogues (activation, GLU, quantization)

- **Price the fusion before tuning inside it.**
  - **Tax** = fused kernel minus the same-shape bare GEMM, from one kernel trace. The two kernels often
    share a symbol name; group them by `vgpr_count`, `lds_size` and grid.
  - Then compare the tax with the unfused chain.
  - *(field, E28)* An MXFP4 dGELU + dual-quant epilogue cost 101.9 µs inside the GEMM. The standalone quantizer
    took 100.8 µs, so the fusion broke even. The epilogue inherited the GEMM's one workgroup per CU, which
    dropped its achieved bandwidth from an estimated 4.6 to 3.0 TB/s (435 MiB in 98.4 µs standalone, 294 MiB in
    101.9 µs fused).
- **A static VALU instruction count is not a bottleneck diagnosis.** Use it to confirm a mechanism landed,
  and test causality by deleting instructions and watching wall time. *(field, E29)* In the case above, deleting
  192 VALU (2.7% of the kernel) changed nothing.
- **Measure how much VALU the main loop can absorb before moving work into it.** Insert N dependent FMAs in
  the K-loop gaps with a side-effect sink. *(field, E30)* At occupancy 1, the first 8 FMAs were 65% absorbed and the
  next 8 only 25%. The free pool was about 38% of the epilogue, about 4.8× less than a static estimate.
- **Two co-resident workgroups (occupancy 2) need `LDS ≤ 80 KiB` per workgroup and
  `arch + AGPR ≤ 256` registers per wave, for 4-wave workgroups.** Check both before planning to hide the epilogue behind a second workgroup.
- **Make fused operands meet in one lane.** For GLU (B = gate‖up, `[2I, K]`), point the second B pool at the
  *up* band, `I` weight rows further in, instead of at the next columns. `gate[m, j]` and `up[m, j]` then land
  in the same lane at the same fragment index, and the epilogue pairs them without a shuffle (FP4:2281-2283,
  `gemm_mxfp4_glu_quant_flydsl_kernel`).
- Turbo's fused GLU/dGLU + MXFP4 quantization epilogues are bit-exact against the standalone quantizer
  (`primus_turbo/flydsl/utils/gemm_epilogue_helper.py`).
